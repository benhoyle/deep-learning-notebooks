In accordance with the established practice of the EPO, no search\\nneed be performed in respect of those aspects of the claimed invention.\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nThe only identifiable technical aspects of the claimed invention are deemed to\\nrelate to the use of standard data processing technology that was commonly\\nknown and used in the business framework of the application at its date of\\npriority, see e.g. 01 and 02.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nClaims 1-24 are thus regarded as merely specifying commonplace features\\nrelating to a technological implementation of subject matter excluded from\\npatentability under Art. 52(2) and (3) EPC, without involving an inventive step\\n(Article 56 EPC). Whilst that implementation may include the use of generic\\ntechnical features, these merely serve their well known functions as would be\\nrecognised by the skilled person in the technical field under consideration.\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nThe subject-matter of this application relates to transmitting information to\\ntraders in an electronic trading system.\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nThe problem addressed consists in the very high number of messages that\\nneed to be sent to clients. The bulk of these messages can impose a massive\\nload on the system\\'s devices and can affect trading speed and efficiency.\\n\\n3.7\\n\\nThe solution proposed by the present application consists of a business\\nscheme whereby the messages are prioritised or withheld (and thus delayed)\\nbased on exogenously defined business criteria. These messages are then\\nhandled according to administrative rules of business/financial nature - for\\nexample, the rule defined in claim 1 consists of withholding the lower priority\\ninformation until high priority information is communicated.\\n\\n3.8\\n\\nThis solution is per se of business nature, and therefore as such excluded\\nfrom patentability under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC. Its implementation as\\nproposed in the present application is a mere automation of the above\\nmentioned business solution. The person skilled in the art, made aware of the\\nbusiness scheme, guided by the constraints implied thereby, would\\nimplement it without the exercise of an inventive activity. The only technical\\naspect that is present is the use of a networked computer system for\\nimplementing the basic administrative task. However, the feature of executing\\nthis method on a computer system does not go beyond the basic computer\\nfunctions associated with the implementation of any business scheme on a\\ncomputer system which are standard technology and form part of the general\\nknowledge of the skilled person in the art. When analysing the application,\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01 .91TRI\\n\\n\\x0cDatum\\nDate\\nDate\\n\\nBlatt\\n\\n1 8 . 08 . 2 01 6\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\n3\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n0 7 8 4 4 3 81 . 9\\n\\nthe division was unable to discover any technical details that go beyond\\nmentioning at a very high level the presence of a networked computer system\\nand ordinary collection, processing and exchange of data. It is also noted that\\nno further technical effect can be seen in the implementation of this business\\nscheme.\\n3.9\\n\\nIn particular, in the application it appears to be argued that the\\nimplementation of the above mentioned business scheme reduces the\\nbandwidth and system resource usage. However, even if that were proven to\\nbe the case, it is obseNed that this alleged effect would be anyway obtained\\nby circumventing the problem through an administrative rule (see e.g. the\\nDecision of the Board of Appeal for T0258/03) rather than solving it by\\ntechnical means - the technical characteristics and functioning of the system\\nremain unchanged. It should be obseNed in particular that the different levels\\nof priority attributed to the messages do not reflect any type of technical\\nconsiderations, but are dictated by business criteria.\\n\\n3.1 O\\n\\nAccordingly, although an objection with regard to Article 52(2) and (3) EPC is\\nnot considered tenable, through the limited contribution of the technical\\nfeatures to technical character being judged sufficient, the division notes that\\nthe defined subject-matter in any case lacks inventive step, as no technical\\nsolution to a realised technical problem has been proposed and no technical\\neffect or result which would be unexpected or surprising to the person skilled\\nin the art is apparent (T258/03, T172/03 and T641 /00).\\n\\n3.11\\n\\nIt should be noted that, in a manner similar to the logic applied by the board of\\nappeal in T931 /95, T172/03 and T258/03, the division considers that the\\nperson skilled in the art, with general knowledge of the technical field and\\nnormal access to examples and textbooks, would apply the measures as\\ndescribed in the present application and defined in its claims without the use\\nof inventive skill to arrive at the desired result.\\n\\n3.12\\n\\nReferring specifically to the wording of the claims, the following is observed.\\nThe subject-matter of the claims consists of a mix of technical and nontechnical features. It therefore has technical character as a whole and is an\\ninvention in the sense of Article 52 EPC. The invention will be assessed with\\nrespect to the requirement of inventive step by taking account of all those\\nfeatures which contribute to said technical character, whereas features\\nmaking no such contribution cannot support the presence of inventive step\\n(see inter alia the Decision of the Boards of Appeal for case T0641 /00).\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01.91TRI\\n\\n\\x0cBlatt\\n\\nDatum\\n\\nD~e\\nDate\\n\\n18.08.2016\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\n4\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n0 7 8 4 4 3 81 . 9\\n\\n3.13\\n\\nA claim comprising a mix of both technical and non technical features\\nrequires an examination of the technical character of the claim in order to\\ndetermine those features that are relevant for an assessment of inventive\\nstep.\\n\\n3.14\\n\\nNon-technical features may be considered as those features of a claim that\\ndo not contribute to the technical character of a claim by satisfying the\\nfollowing requirements:\\n• those features considered collectively but independently from the clearly\\ntechnical features of the claim that define subject-matter excluded from\\npatentability under Article 52(2) and (2) EPC, wherein\\n• those features do not combine with the clearly technical features of the\\nclaim in a way such as to provide a resulting combination that has a\\ndifferent technical character to that defined by the clearly technical\\nfeatures alone.\\n\\n3.15\\n\\nClaim 1 clearly has technical character in so far the subject-matter of the\\nclaim relates to a system comprising a client, an intermediary network device\\nand an electronic exchange.\\n\\n3.16\\n\\nIt is clear that the aim of the invention is to facilitating the provision of financial\\ninformation to traders (see the description of the application, e.g. p. 3, last\\npar). Therefore, the claim is prima facie made up of technical and nontechnical features.\\n\\n3.17\\n\\nThe non-technical features of claim 1 are:\\nPrioritising the delivery of financial trading information to a trader, comprising:\\nan intermediary centrally receiving a plurality of messages associated with a\\ntradeable object;\\nthe intermediary determining a priority level of a received message based on\\none or more pre-set criteria, the priority level comprising one of a lower\\npriority level and a higher priority level,\\nwherein where a message is determined to be of a lower priority level, the\\nintermediary is instructed to withhold the information corresponding to said\\nmessage and, when at least one of a number of pre-defined conditions is\\nsatisfied, communicates said information to the trader,\\nwherein where a message is determined to be of a higher priority level, the\\nintermediary is instructed to communicate the information corresponding to\\nsaid message to the trader without withholding that information,\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01 .91TRI\\n\\n\\x0cD~e\\nDate\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\nBlatt\\n\\nDatum\\n\\n18.08.2016\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\n5\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n0 7 8 4 4 3 81 . 9\\n\\nwherein one of said number of pre-defined conditions comprises the condition\\nthat a message is subsequently received at the intermediary and is\\ndetermined to be of a higher priority level, such that, following receipt of said\\nmessage of a higher priority level, withheld information corresponding to one\\nor more messages of a lower priority level along with information\\ncorresponding to the received message of a higher priority level is\\ncommunicated to the trader.\\n3.18\\n\\nThe above features relate purely to a business, non-technical scheme and are\\ntherefore as such excluded from patentability and do not contribute to an\\ninventive step.\\n\\n3.19\\n\\nThe technical features of claim 1 are:\\nA system for data delivery to a client in an electronic trading environment,\\ncomprising:\\nan intermediary network device receiving messages from an electronic\\nexchange, the intermediary network device comprising a data structure, the\\nintermediary network device being able to process the messages, store them\\nin the date structure and/or send them to the client.\\n\\n3.20\\n\\nThese technical features are commonplace, and can in fact be considered to\\nbe notoriously known. In any case, should documentary evidence deemed to\\nbe required, the division refers to the above cited documents 01 and 02.\\nFurthermore, these technical features have no technical interaction with the\\nnon-technical features presented at 3.17 above. No technical interrelationship is disclosed in the application, nor can the examining division\\nidentify any. The above mentioned non-technical features therefore cause no\\ntechnical effect and have no relevance for the purpose of assessing inventive\\nstep (see the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office, GVll, 5.2 and 5.4, see also the decisions of the Boards of Appeal for cases\\nT0641 /00, T0258/03, T0172/03).\\n\\n3.21\\n\\nIt is the division\\'s opinion that the person skilled in the art would consider it to\\nbe part of his routine daily work to adapt the well known technical features of\\n3.19 above in order to implement the proposed business scheme. Any\\ntechnical considerations which might be involved in such adaptation derive\\nfrom the prior art in a straightforward way and do not involve any technical\\ningenuity, hence they cannot contribute positively to inventive step. In other\\nwords, the technical features of claim 1 being well known from the prior art,\\nthe only differentiating aspect of the claim resides in the business scheme\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01 .91TRI\\n\\n\\x0cBlatt\\n\\nDatum\\nDate\\nDate\\n\\n18.08.2016\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\n6\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n0 7 8 4 4 3 81 . 9\\n\\nbeing implemented thereon. However, this scheme is purely non-technical,\\nthus it cannot be considered to add anything of inventive significance to the\\nsubject-matter of the claim.\\nThe subject-matter of claim 1 of the main request thus lacks an inventive step\\nin the sense of Article 56 EPC.\\n3.22\\n\\nIndependent claim 13 defines the subject-matter of claim 1 in terms of a\\nmethod, similar objections therefore apply mutatis mutandis. The subjectmatter of claim 13 lacks inventive step (Art. 56 EPC).\\n\\n3.23\\n\\nDependent claims 2-12 and 14-24 do not appear to contain any additional\\nfeatures which, in combination with the features of any claim to which they\\nrefer, meet the requirements of the EPC with respect to inventive step, as the\\nsubject-matter of these claims defines the straightforward implementation of\\nfurther options and details of the underlying business scheme.\\n\\n4\\n\\nAPPLICANTS\\' ARGUMENTS\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nIn the letter of 20.06.2012 the applicants argued essentially as follows:\\n\\nA technical problem that is solved by the presently claimed invention may be\\nsummarised as: how to provide an efficient mechanism for data distribution in\\nan information delivery network that reduces the burden on network devices.\\nThis is a technical problem as it relates to considerations of the technical\\ndevices in the network that handle message traffic. It is relevant to a person\\nskilled in the art of communication networks - they are tasked with developing\\na technical mechanism.\\nIn the search opinion the Examiner cites Decision of the Board of Appeal for\\nT0258/03. The present application is distinguished from this case by at least\\nthe following features:\\n• In T0258/03, the overall aim of the method therein was to identify the\\nsuccessful bidder for a product offered for sale at an auction - an aim that was\\ndeemed not to have technical character.\\no In contrast, the overall aim of the presently claimed invention is provide an\\nefficient mechanism for data distribution in an information-delivery network\\nthat reduces the burden on network devices - an aim that does have technical\\ncharacter.\\n• In T0258/03, the claim in question set out method steps consisting of\\nmodifications to a business scheme.\\nEPO Form 2906 01.91 TRI\\n\\n\\x0cD~e\\nDate\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\nBlatt\\n\\nDatum\\n\\n18.08.2016\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\n7\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n07 844 381. 9\\n\\no In contrast, the presently claimed invention consists of modifications to an\\nintermediary network device (i.e. a technical entity), in particular the\\nmodifications relate to how an intermediary network device processes\\nincoming messages.\\n• In T0258/03, a prominent feature of the invention was that when more than\\none bidder offers a certain \"desired price\\'\\', an auction price was increased to\\nsort out the lower bids - this could just as well be used for conducting a Dutch\\nauction without computer support.\\no In contrast, the features of presently claimed invention make no reference\\nto \\'\\'prices\" or \"bids\" - only technical features such as messages, data, data\\nstructures and devices are specified.\\nWhen compared to a system comprising an electronic exchange coupled to a\\nclient device, the presently claimed invention provides the unexpected\\ntechnical effect of reducing the burden on the client device by utilising a\\nspecifically adapted intermediary device. This effect is surprising as it goes\\nbeyond any obvious modification of data delivery between an electronic\\nexchange and a client device and offers real improvements to the information\\ndelivery network.\\n4.2\\n\\nAs explained above (see 3.9 ), even if a lesser burden on the client device\\nwere proven to be achieved, the solution proposed by the present application\\ncannot be considered to involve an inventive step as it circumvents the\\nproblem by modifying non-technical, business rules rather than solving the\\nproblem by technical means. Indeed, the electronic components of the\\nsystem work in a thoroughly standard way, the only modification residing in\\nstraightforward programming of the intermediary device so as to implement\\nthe proposed business scheme.\\nAs regards the applicants\\' observations on decision T0258/03, the division\\nnotes the following:\\n- the technical problem identified as underlying the application at issue in that\\ndecision resided in the delays in data transmission (see reasons for the\\ndecision, 5.)\\n- in the present case, the modifications to the intermediary network device\\nmerely reside in programming said device according to the underlying\\nbusiness rules. Similarly, suitable programming of the relevant electronic\\ndevice(s) was involved in the case of the decision.\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01 .91TRI\\n\\n\\x0cD~e\\nDate\\n\\nAnmelde-Nr:\\n\\nBlatt\\n\\nDatum\\n\\n18.08.2016\\n\\nSheet\\nFeuille\\n\\n8\\n\\nApplication No:\\nDemande n°:\\n\\n0 7 8 4 4 3 81 . 9\\n\\n- in the division\\'s view, the difference in the non-technical framework of the\\napplication with respect to the case at issue in the decision does not detract\\nfrom the applicability of its conclusions to the present case.\\n\\n5\\n\\nGENERAL\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nIt is not at present apparent which part of the application could serve as a\\nbasis for a new, allowable claim. Should the applicant nevertheless regard\\nsome particular matter as patentable, a new set of claims could be filed\\ntaking account of Rule 43(1) EPC.\\n\\n5.2\\n\\nWhen filing amended claims the applicant should at the same time bring the\\ndescription into conformity with the amended claims. Care should be taken\\nduring revision, especially of the introductory portion and any statements of\\nproblem or advantage, not to add subject-matter which extends beyond the\\ncontent of the application as originally filed (Article 123(2) EPC).\\n\\n5.3\\n\\nIn order to facilitate the examination of the conformity of the amended\\napplication with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC, the applicant is\\nrequested to clearly identify the amendments carried out, irrespective of\\nwhether they concern amendments by addition, replacement or deletion, and\\nto indicate the passages of the application as filed on which these amendments are based.\\n\\nEPO Form 2906 01.91 TRI\\n\\n\\x0c'"
