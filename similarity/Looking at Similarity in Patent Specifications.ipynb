       "4 Skimming is commonly defined as the theft of credit or debit card information used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. For example, thieves may skim card numbers by installing credit card readers and/or false keyboards and cameras in an ATM machine. The theft occurs when an unsuspecting user inserts a credit or debit card into the compromised reader, which copies the information on the card. The user then enters their personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM keypad. The PIN is captured by camera, or for ATMs with out touch screens, by an overlay device installed over or in the ATM keypad. Using a magnetic card writer, a commonly available device, the thieves duplicate the information from the card's magnetic stripe onto a dummy card. They then use the dummy card and stolen PIN in an ATM machine (or other point-of-sale device) to empty the user's bank account or make illegal purchases. Skimmers have targeted many ATMs, even some installed inside bank premises."

Goods are shipped in a transport box having an interior space and a device for controlling the temperature within the interior space. The delivery box has at least one interior transport box receptacle where a transport box containing goods is placed on delivery. A power and data interface is established between a delivery box control circuit and a transport box control circuit. The transport box is placed into one of the receptacles, so that the delivery box control circuit can power the transport box control circuit and environment-controlling device. A security code is downloaded from an Internet merchant site to the delivery box and stored onto a keycard when an order is placed.'), (2, 'This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/379,771, filed Feb. 27, 2009.'), (3, '1. Field of the Invention'), (4, 'The present invention relates to the delivery of goods purchased via Internet-based electronic commerce and, more particularly, to a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet.'), (5, '2. Description of the Related Art'), (6, 'The Internet has opened a vast electronic frontier for consumers, enabling the consumers to shop, from the convenience and comfort of their own home or business, among countless providers of all types of goods. Electronic commerce, merged with the Internet and the World Wide Web, facilitates the purchase of goods by integrating a variety of payment services so that, after browsing the Web and browsing merchant websites, goods may be purchased essentially with the click of a button.'), (7, 'Once an order for goods has been placed with an Internet merchant, the goods of course must be delivered to the customer. While conventional forms of delivery, including the U.S. mail, express and overnight delivery services and other forms of mail and package delivery, and other common delivery and shipping methods and services, suffice for many items ordered on the Internet, some items require special handling for proper delivery. Food or other perishable items may require special care, such as maintenance of proper temperatures during delivery and after delivery if the food items delivered are left unattended. High value items may require special handling for security, or will require insurance against the loss or theft of the items during the course of delivery. The lack of a delivery service specialized to accommodate special handling for some goods may discourage a vibrant Internet marketplace for the goods if customers are concerned about receiving goods in good condition (such as frozen food items that may arrive thawed) or if Internet merchants or their customers must bear excessive costs to insure goods for delivery. Additionally, delivery of some goods is hampered if the recipient is not present to receive the goods, since shippers and merchants are reluctant to have certain goods left unattended.'), (8, 'Various receptacles have been employed to receive delivered goods. An example is a locked mailbox with a delivery slot that allows letters or very small packages to be inserted into the mailbox, and only removed by a recipient with a key. This provides a degree of security for the letters and small packages, but does not prevent receipt of unwanted items. Additionally, provision for maintaining an environmental condition is lacking. Larger lock boxes have been devised to overcome package size limitations. However, no known lock box addresses all phases of delivery of goods to provide security and proper handling of goods with special needs.'), (9, 'Thus, a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet solving the aforementioned problems is desired.'), (10, 'The system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet employs a delivery box for receiving goods ordered via the Internet, and transport boxes for delivery of goods requiring special handling during delivery. The delivery box has at least one inner bay for receiving a transport box containing delivered goods. The transport box may include means for providing for special handling requirements of goods, such as a lock that interacts with the delivery box such that the transport box may only be opened upon delivery or by an authorized delivery person, or means for maintaining an environmental parameter, such as a cold or a warm temperature, for proper storage during delivery of goods that have particular environmental needs.'), (11, 'The delivery box has at least one secure door for access to the interior of the delivery box, and may have a second door for access in a pass-through fashion. In one embodiment, the delivery box is configured for through-wall mounting, having a secure outside door and an inside door such that goods are delivered into the delivery box through the secure outside door, and are removed by the customer through the inside door.'), (12, 'Access through the secure door is controlled by an electronic lock, in conjunction with a user key interface that may be a keycard reader, an electronic cipher lock, a radio frequency identification (RFID) key reader, or another similar electronic lock and key arrangement. To gain access into the delivery box, a delivery person must therefore have an appropriately matching coded key, or must know a correct cipher lock code. A unique code is assigned for each delivery, helping to ensure that access to the delivery box is only obtained by a delivery person making an expected delivery, and facilitating tracking of the order.'), (13, 'The delivery box is in communication with the Internet such that when a customer places an order to purchase goods using the Internet, a unique delivery code associated with the purchase order is created and delivered both to the delivery box and with the purchase order to the Internet merchant, the delivery code being encrypted for security. Along with the delivery code, delivery instructions are generated that include an identification number or code for the destination delivery box, time and place for delivery, handling instructions (such as a requirement to keep frozen foods cold) and security instructions. The ordered goods are placed into a transport box that is configured according to the delivery instructions, such as providing a transport box with refrigerating capability for frozen foods. Delivery instructions may be downloaded to the transport box and the delivery box, for example, to set a holding temperature to maintain the goods or to deliver GPS coordinates for the delivery location.'), (14, \"The Internet merchant provides to a delivery person or service means for accessing the customer's delivery box, by providing a programmable keycard or other electronic key device, or providing a cipher lock code, or the like. Delivery access code information may be provided via a secure server over the Internet from the Internet merchant, who produces the corresponding keycard at the time of paid order confirmation, to the delivery service. The electronic key device bearing the access code is used upon delivery, and may be left with the delivered goods as a receipt.\"), (15, 'On delivery of the goods to the delivery site, a delivery person uses the electronic key device to gain access into the delivery box, placing the goods into the delivery box. A transport box may interact with the delivery box to perform security functions, or to receive power from the delivery box to ensure continuation of environmental parameters or other settings maintained by the transport box. The transport box, equipped with a GPS, may compare the actual location with the expected delivery location to verify that the goods have been properly delivered. A mismatch causes an alarm, such as illuminating an indicator light or generating a service warning. In the case of high value goods, a mismatch may disable a lock on the transport box, preventing access to the goods within. This serves both to enhance security of deliveries of high value goods, and to prevent accidental erroneous deliveries when a delivery person, carrying multiple transport boxes, places the wrong transport box into a delivery box.'), (16, 'On receipt of goods, the delivery box creates a signal to alert the customer that the goods have arrived, and creates and forwards a tracking confirmation to the Internet merchant.'), (17, 'These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.'), (18, 'FIG. 1 is an environmental, perspective view of a delivery box for a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (19, 'FIG. 2 is a front view of the delivery box illustrated in FIG. 1, showing a keycard reader on the front door of the delivery box.'), (20, 'FIG. 3 is a side view of the delivery box illustrated in FIG. 1, shown mounted through a wall for pass-through access.'), (21, 'FIG. 4 is a bottom/front perspective view of a transport box used with the delivery box illustrated in FIG. 1.'), (22, 'FIG. 5 is a block diagram of electronic components of a delivery box in communication with a transport box.'), (23, 'FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (24, 'FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a process for Internet purchase order entry in a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (25, 'FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a process for order fulfillment in a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (26, 'FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a process for order receipt at a delivery box in a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (27, 'FIG. 10 is a flowchart of a process for customer receipt of an order in a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet according to the present invention.'), (28, 'FIG. 11 is a side view of the delivery box illustrated in FIG. 3, detailing control accessories mounted on the inside access door.'), (29, 'FIG. 12A is a flowchart of a point of reception weight verification process according to the present invention.'), (30, 'FIG. 12B is a flowchart of a point of sale weight of goods registration process according to the present invention.'), (31, 'Similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the attached drawings.'), (32, 'As shown in FIGS. 1-3, the system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet employs a delivery box 100 having a front door 102 securable by an electronic lock 104 for access to a large interior space 120. In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic lock 104 includes a keycard reader 106, such as a magnetic strip card reader or the like, for reading a keycard 105 to gain entry to the interior space 120. The delivery box 100 may be embodied in a stand-alone configuration, having only the front door 102 for access, or in a wall-mounted pass-through configuration as illustrated, seen mounted through a wall W in FIG. 3, having additionally a second door 110 for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. The delivery box 100, especially in the stand-alone configuration, may be used for mobile applications as well as at a fixed location. The second door 110 may include a lock 112 for security, such as a key lock or an electronic cipher lock so that access to the interior space 120 can controlled through both the front door 102 and the second door 110. The delivery box 100 has a controller circuit 150 in communication with the locks 104 and 112, to manage access codes and access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100.'), (33, 'The interior space 120 of the delivery box 100 is divided into smaller spaces, including one or more transport box receptacles 122 adapted to receive goods packaged in a transport box 200. At least one additional space 126 is provided for receiving goods not packaged in a transport box 200. Each transport box receptacle 122 includes electrical contacts 124 disposed therein to provide electrical power to matching contacts on a transport box 200, the electrical power powering a refrigerating, heating, or other device contained within the transport box 200. Additionally, electrical contacts may provide for a data communication between the controller circuit 150, of the delivery box 100, and a controller circuit 250 contained in the transport box 200. Alternatively, a wireless method of communication may be used for communication between the controller circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 and the controller circuit 250 contained in the transport box 200.'), (34, 'Turning now to FIG. 4, a transport box 200 is shown in greater detail. A transport box 200 is a container having an interior space 202 for receiving goods for transport or shipment. A hinged or removable cover 204 allows access to the interior space 202. The transport box 200 includes environment control means 206 for controlling the environment within the interior space, such as a resistance or other type of heating device, a Peltier thermoelectric device for heating and cooling, a miniaturized Stirling cycle cooler, or other devices for providing heating and or cooling to the interior space 202. Note that, in some embodiments, a passive means for maintaining heat or cold, such as an ice pack, may be used.'), (35, 'In the illustrated embodiment, a control circuit 250 is in communication with the environment control means 206 and operates the environment control means 206 to maintain a predetermined environment within the interior space 202. Electrical contacts 208 on the outside of the transport box 200 are adapted for engagement with the electrical contacts 124 in a transport box receptacle 122 within a delivery box 100. An electronic locking mechanism 210 may be provided in communication with the control circuit 250, whereby the transport box 200 may be locked until unlocked by the control circuit 250, such as when the control circuit recognizes that the transport box 200 has been placed within a transport box receptacle 122 within a delivery box 100.'), (36, 'Turning now to FIG. 5, a block diagram illustrates the relationship between the various electrical components of a delivery box 100, and a transport box 200 placed within transport box receptacle 122 of the delivery box 100. On placement of the transport box 200 into a transport box receptacle 122 within the delivery box 100, a communication interface 158 is established between the delivery box 100 control circuit 150 and the transport box 200 control circuit 250. The control circuit 150 and the control circuit 250 communicate across the electrical contacts 124 in connection with electrical contacts 208. A wireless interface is established between control circuit 150 and control circuit 250 in an alternate embodiment.'), (37, 'The delivery box 100 control circuit 150 is in communication, via a communication interface 152, with the Internet 20. The communication interface 152 may employ a wireless technology for remote communication. The control circuit 150 is also in communication with the card reader 106 and the electronic lock 104, reading a security code from an electronic keycard 105 swiped through, or inserted into, the card reader 106 and activating the electronic lock 104 according to a valid or an invalid security code. Similarly, if the lock 112 on the second door 110 of the delivery box 100 is an electronic lock, the control circuit 150 may be in communication with lock 112, and, optionally, a user interface 154 such as a keypad or electronic key reader or the like for controlling or recording user access to the delivery box.'), (38, 'The control circuit 150 also includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 151. The GPS receiver 151 is used to determine the location of the delivery box 100 for delivery purposes. In a mobile application, or for a fixed location application where the location of the delivery box 100 is not well described by a street address or other means, the GPS coordinates of the location of the delivery box 100 are used instead of an address to identify the location of the delivery box 100 for deliveries.'), (39, 'The control circuit 150 may also operate a heating and/or cooling device 156 disposed within an interior space of the delivery box 100. The control circuit 150 preferably includes a microcomputer or microcontroller, or other type of programmable logic device, and a memory for storing programming instructions.'), (40, 'Weight sensors 500 may be disposed inside the delivery box 100 and communicate with the controller 150. As shown in FIG. 12A, the weight of delivery goods may be measured and then registered via step 1202 at the point of sale (POS) and stored in the controller of the transport box via step 1204. Software in the controller 150 may be programmed to compare the weight of the delivered goods at the point of reception (POR), i.e., at the delivery box 100, with the weight of the delivery goods recorded at the point of sale. As shown in FIG. 12B, the POR processing entails the POS weight of goods being retrieved from the transport box controller at step 1206 and compared with the sensor reading at step 1208. Any weight discrepancy results in notification of the recipient at step 1210 and notification of the merchant at step 1212. If the weight is included in the shipping instructions, the goods delivery may be rejected based on non-compliance with the shipping instructions due to weight discrepancy. Otherwise, a ready-OK indication notifies the user (recipient) at step 1214.'), (41, 'The transport box 200 control circuit 250 of the illustrated embodiment includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 252, and a wireless communications interface 254 such as Bluetooth, wireless Ethernet (802.11b) or a similar technology. The control circuit 250 is in communication with the electronic locking mechanism 210, and with the environment control means 206 comprising a heating 258 and/or a cooling device 256. The control circuit 250 preferably includes a microcomputer or microcontroller, or other type of programmable logic device, and a memory for storing programming instructions.'), (42, \"Turning now to FIG. 6, a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet is illustrated employing a delivery box 100 in communication with the Internet 20. A customer using a customer computer 12 to access the Internet 20 browses the World Wide Web seeking an Internet merchant of desired goods, and places an order for delivery of goods to the customer's delivery box 100. An Internet merchant server 14 in communication with the Internet 20 receives a customer order for goods, along with delivery instructions for the goods, and dispatches the order for fulfillment to a warehouse 16, such as by way of vendor or warehouse computer 15 in communication with the server 14 via the Internet 20. An identification or security code is generated for the order, and a keycard is created bearing code in an electronically readable format. The goods are packaged into a transport box 200, and electronic delivery instructions downloaded into the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200, along with the keycard. A shipping or transportation company 18 delivers the transport box 200 to the customer's delivery box 100, using the keycard to open the delivery box 100, whereupon the transport box 200 is placed into a transport box receptacle 122 within the delivery box 100 for access by the customer.\"), (43, 'Turning now to FIGS. 7-10, a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet is described, the method employing a delivery box 100, a transport box 200, and the system briefly described in FIG. 6. The method may be embodied in a computer program executing on an Internet merchant server 14, and in programming of the control circuit 150 in the delivery box and programming of the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200. In such an embodiment, the computer program generally functions as a Web service to provide customer interface functions to a client program such as an Internet browser functioning on a customer computer 12.'), (44, \"A method for entering an order by a customer is described in FIG. 7. A customer begins the process by browsing the Internet 20, and particularly a merchant Web site, to locate goods for purchase (step 702). With goods selected, an order is entered (step 704), identifying a delivery address for the customer, or the location of the delivery box 100 indicated by the GPS 151, and identifying the customer's delivery box 100. The order entry includes completion of a payment transaction, wherein the customer enters payment information such as a credit card number or appropriate identification for another online payment service.\"), (45, 'Once the order is entered, and payment confirmed, a unique delivery or access code is generated (step 706), and a keycard 105 is generated containing the delivery or access code. The delivery code will function as a security code for delivery access to the delivery box 100, and also may be used to track the order. Note that separate security and tracking codes may be used. Codes are preferably encrypted for distribution, over the Internet, to the merchant and the delivery box 100. Delivery instructions are then generated (step 708). The delivery instructions may include electronic delivery instructions that are downloadable into the delivery box 100 and into a transport box 200, identifying special handling for the goods that will be supported by the delivery box 100 and transport box 200.'), (46, 'In the above, additional security may be provided by the usage of additional wireless or hardwired sensors. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a wireless tag, such as a radio frequency ID (RFID) chip 300 may be embedded within keycard 105. Alternatively, such a wireless tag may be carried by the delivery person, RFID chip 300 (or any other wireless transmitter) includes either the same access code or a secondary access code, which is transmitted and received by a wireless sensor 302, mounted on the interior of door 102, or mounted in any other suitable location within the system. In order to access the interior, the delivery person needs to swipe the keycard 105, which has the proper access code encoded thereon, and also have the wireless tag 300. Alternatively, a wired system may be utilized. Sensor 302 is in communication with controller 250.'), (47, 'Additionally, a similar sensor 304 (as shown in FIG. 1) may be mounted on the interior side of the system, requiring the interior, household user to also have an encoded wireless tag. Further, as shown in FIG. 3, a computer port 306, such as a USB port or the like, may be incorporated in the internal door 110, with sensor 304 and USB port 306 also being in communication with controller 250. In order to access the interior, the user needs to have the properly encoded wireless tag, along with a portable device or computer, also having an encrypted code stored thereon, which is transmitted to controller 250 via port 306. It should be understood that any suitable type of sensor may be utilized, and any suitable type of computer interface may also be utilized. The wireless sensors and USB port shown in the Figures are shown for exemplary purposes only.'), (48, \"The electronic delivery instructions include temperature or environmental parameters that will be maintained by the delivery box 100 and transport box 200, and may also include security instructions such as a geographic area or GPS location where delivery is to occur. The delivery instructions may also include a due date or time, or an expiration time for the order. The order, security code, and delivery instructions are forwarded to the merchant or a warehouse facility 16 for fulfillment of the order (step 710), and are forwarded to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 712).\"), (49, \"A method for fulfilling an order at a merchant or warehouse facility 16 is described in FIG. 8. The order, security code, and delivery instructions are received by the merchant or warehouse facility (step 802). The order is fulfilled (step 804) by identifying the ordered goods, and preparing them for shipment. With reference to the order and delivery instructions, the merchant or warehouse facility determines if a transport box 200 will be needed for delivery of the goods (step 806). If the goods require a controlled environment or temperature during shipping, or if the delivery instructions require special security for the goods, a transport box 200 is used. The transport box 200 is prepared by downloading the security code and delivery instructions to the transport box 200, the delivery instructions being stored within the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200 (step 808). The goods are packed into the transport box and the transport box is electromechanically locked (step 810). The goods are then delivered to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 812).\"), (50, 'During the course of transport for delivery, the transport box 200 maintains a proper temperature for holding the goods. Additionally, the transport box 200 control circuit 250 may monitor the GPS 252 to determine if the transport box 200 has been transported outside of a pre-determined geographic area, indicated in the delivery instructions, such that the transport box 200 may have been stolen, misrouted, or mishandled. An alert may be forwarded by the transport box 200, by wireless connection to the Internet, to the merchant, shipper, or customer.'), (51, \"Turning now to FIGS. 9 and 10, a method for delivering goods to the customer's delivery box 100, and subsequently to the customer, is described. When a delivery person arrives at the customer's delivery box 100, a security code must be entered for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. In the illustrated embodiment, a keycard 105, carrying a security code in a computer readable format, is swiped through the card reader 106, whereupon the control circuit 150 reads the security code (step 902). If the code read is not a valid code (checked at 904), the control circuit 150 does not activate the electronic lock 104 for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. Instead, a notification may be made to alert the customer that an unauthorized or unexpected attempt to open the delivery box 100 was made (step 918).\"), (52, 'If a valid security code is read, an order stored by the control circuit 150 is retrieved (step 906) along with the delivery instructions for the order. The order may be accepted or rejected (at 908) depending on whether or not the delivery of goods complies with the delivery instructions. For example, delivery instructions for an order may have specified a delivery deadline that has been missed. If the order is rejected, a notification is sent to the vendor (or shipper) (step 916), and the customer may be notified (at 918). If the order is accepted, the control circuit 150 commands the electronic lock 104 to open (step 910), allowing access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. On entry to the delivery box 100, the delivery person may find an old transport box 200 left over from a previous delivery, in which case the old transport box 200 is removed for return to the merchant or shipper (step 911). If the delivered goods are packaged in a transport box 200, the transport box 200 is placed into a transport box receptacle 122 (step 912) within the delivery box 100, whereupon the electrical contacts 208 on the transport box 200 are brought into contact with the electrical contacts 124 of the transport box receptacle 122. Goods delivered without a transport box 200 are placed in an additional space 126 within the delivery box 100.'), (53, 'With a transport box 200 placed into a transport box receptacle 122, the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200 communicates with the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100. The order and delivery instructions stored in the transport box 200 are compared against the order and delivery instructions stored in the delivery box 100, to verify that the correct order has been received. If there is a mismatch (decided at step 914), for example when a delivery person has opened the delivery box 100 with the correct keycard 105 but placed a wrong transport box 200 inside by mistake, an alert is issued, and the vendor may be notified (at 916) and the customer may be notified (at 918).'), (54, 'Continuing on FIG. 10, once the order is completed with goods placed into the delivery box 100, the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 may cause an alert to notify the customer of the delivery of the goods (step 1002). In some configurations, the customer will be required to enter a security code to gain access to the goods within the delivery box 100. In a delivery box 100 having only front door 102 for access, for example, the customer will need to enter a code to unlock the door. Similarly, if a second door 110 is configured with an electronic lock such as electronic cipher lock 112, a security code may be required for the customer to gain entry. If a security code is required (at step 1004), the customer enters the code and the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 reads the security code. If a valid code is entered, the control circuit 150 allows the customer to open a door for removal of the goods. If the goods are not in a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016) once a door is open for delivery. If the goods are contained within a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be retained until the transport box 200 is removed from its transport box receptacle 122. If the transport box 200 is not timely removed from the transport box receptacle 122 after the delivery box 100 is opened by the customer (determined at 1014), a reminder may be generated to notify the customer (step 1012). Once the transport box is removed, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016).'), (55, 'An alternative embodiment of the delivery box 100, shown in FIG. 11, features a PC pluggable interface 3002 which is attached to the inside access door 110 and provides a plug-in connection for a PC unit to allow control/status functions (e.g., lock/unlock, thermal control, status, and the like) to be issued/accessed therefrom, which are acted upon by the controller circuit 150 of the delivery box 100. Thus, the plug-in PC unit may perform the functions of the inside user interface 154. Alternatively to the PC pluggable interface 3002, a slotted tablet attachment bar 3000 is provided on the outside of the inside access door 110, so that a wireless tablet 1102 can be retained via the lengthwise slot in the attachment bar 3000. The controller circuit 150 may be adapted for communication with the wireless tablet 1102, thereby allowing lock/unlock, status commands, and the like, to be issued using the wireless tablet 1102.'), (56, 'It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims.')]\n"

      "[(1, 'Systems and methods are provided to prevent unauthorized credit and debit transactions. A system creates a transactional, or one-time-use PIN in response to a request from a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, belonging to an authorized user. This PIN is securely transmitted to the mobile device, and used in combination with a credit or debit account number to complete the transaction. The user is determined to be authorized by the fact that they are able to access an application on the mobile device that sends the request. The application itself may be protected using a non-changing PIN.'), (2, 'This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/453,911, filed Mar. 17, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.'), (3, 'The present invention relates to preventing identity theft, and more particularly to the use of a mobile device and a one-time PIN to prevent harm arising from credit and debit card skimming.'), (4, \"Skimming is commonly defined as the theft of credit or debit card information used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. For example, thieves may skim card numbers by installing credit card readers and/or false keyboards and cameras in an ATM machine. The theft occurs when an unsuspecting user inserts a credit or debit card into the compromised reader, which copies the information on the card. The user then enters their personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM keypad. The PIN is captured by camera, or for ATMs with out touch screens, by an overlay device installed over or in the ATM keypad. Using a magnetic card writer, a commonly available device, the thieves duplicate the information from the card's magnetic stripe onto a dummy card. They then use the dummy card and stolen PIN in an ATM machine (or other point-of-sale device) to empty the user's bank account or make illegal purchases. Skimmers have targeted many ATMs, even some installed inside bank premises.\"), (5, \"Skimming represents an ongoing problem that costs financial institutions fees in the form of charge backs, fraud detection programs, and fraudulent purchase refund guarantees to consumers, among others. While some groups in Europe have installed smartcards into their plastic credit and debit cards to prevent card duplication, this does not prevent a thief who skims a PIN from stealing the physical card (perhaps, by waiting around the corner from the ATM machine). The thief will still be able to drain the user's bank account if he acts quickly, before the user has an opportunity to report that the card has been stolen.\"), (6, \"A principle problem with skimming is that the authentication factors used to complete the transaction, namely the account number and PIN, do not change. To solve this problem, various embodiments of the invention create a “transactional” PIN. The transactional PIN is useful only for a single transaction, and may also be useful for only a limited time, such as five minutes. The PIN is created in response to a request made by an application that is downloaded onto a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. Thus, the burden of authentication is transferred from the ATM or other transactional device to the user's mobile device. Authentication is guaranteed because the individual must first authenticate to their mobile device (and to the application thereon). The credit or debit card then becomes merely a physical token that may be combined with the authentication factors used by the individual to log in to their mobile device to provide complete authentication for the transaction.\"), (7, 'Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for authenticating a physical token as part of initiation of a commercial credit or debit transaction. The physical token may be a credit card or debit card having a magnetic stripe in which are stored data pertaining to a credit account or a debit account. The transaction is implemented using a transactional device, such as an ATM or point-of-sale device having a magnetic stripe reader.'), (8, 'The method includes a number of processes. First, the method includes receiving, in a computer system from a mobile device, a request to initiate the transaction, the request including data pertinent to the transaction. The computer system may be located remotely, on the premises of a financial institution, or it may be part of the transactional device itself. The mobile device may be a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, or a laptop computer, among other devices. The request data optionally may include data identifying a party seeking to initiate the transaction, a withdrawal amount, a good or service that is the subject of the transaction, or a sales price.'), (9, 'Next, the method calls for generating a transactional PIN in the computer system, encrypting the transactional PIN using an encryption key uniquely associated with the mobile device, and transmitting the encrypted transactional PIN to the mobile device. Finally, the method calls for receiving from the transactional device the unencrypted transactional PIN and data pertaining to the physical token, before a pre-specified expiration time. The pre-specified expiration time may be, for example, no greater than 60 seconds after receiving the request. The short-range wireless network may include, among other things, a near-field communications network or a cellular telephone network. If the computer system is part of the transactional device, it may use the short-range wireless network to transmit the encrypted transactional PIN to the mobile device.'), (10, 'In this way, receiving the unencrypted transactional PIN indicates that the encrypted transactional PIN was decrypted by the mobile device using a decryption key uniquely associated with the mobile device. Further, receiving the unencrypted transactional PIN and the physical token before the pre-specified expiration time indicates that the same individual possesses the unencrypted PIN and the physical token, so as to authenticate the physical token.'), (11, \"ATMs that use embodiments of this invention can prevent the fraudulent transactions associated with skimming. Even if the ATM is compromised via skimming, and a consumer's information is stolen, the thieves cannot get a usable PIN for future use. Any reuse of the PIN with that card (or a dummy card) will cause the ATM to alert the financial institution to the presence of a possible skimmer. Since the PIN is unique, the location of the skimmer can now be determined. Along with a timestamp and video footage, the image of the perpetrator can be recovered, and sent to law enforcement authorities.\"), (12, \"Advantageously, the invention may be embodied without any change to existing ATM hardware. Also, ATM transactions work unchanged, and no slow down is experienced by the customer. A software change is required, but only at the financial institution. On the customer's end, a user only has to install a new application on their mobile device (such as a smartphone). Banks already provide small screen-enabled websites and smartphone applications for mobile devices. It is contemplated that this invention may be embodied as another such application. Further, such a system may be used with all types of credit or debit card transactions, not just those at ATMs.\"), (13, 'A computer program product and a mobile device for use with this method are also contemplated.'), (14, 'The foregoing features will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:'), (15, 'FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing logical processes for registering a mobile device with a financial institution to prepare for use in a transaction in accordance of an embodiment of the present invention;'), (16, 'FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction; and'), (17, 'FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for using a PIN in a particular transaction.'), (18, 'Definitions. As used in this description and the accompanying claims, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated, unless the context otherwise requires:'), (19, 'A “mobile device” is any device, such as a smartphone, personal digital assistant, personal computer, laptop, tablet computer or other device that may perform cryptographic operations and communicate on a short-range wireless data network, such as wireless telephone or near-field communications (NFC) network.'), (20, \"FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing logical processes for registering a mobile device with a financial institution to prepare for use in a transaction in accordance of an embodiment of the present invention. In process 110, a user requests a transactional software application from her financial institution, for use on her mobile device. The concept of such applications generally is well known in the art, but this particular application is new in that it allows the user to receive and process a transactional PIN. In process 120, the financial institution verifies that the user is authorized to download the application. If the user is not authorized, then the method ends in process 130, which may include notifying an authorized user of an attempted, unauthorized transaction. If the user is authorized, then the method continues in process 140, in which the financial institution sends the software application to the user's mobile device as indicated. In process 150, the financial institution updates a database to indicate that the user has downloaded the application and is allowed to access and use the application for commercial transactions.\"), (21, \"FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction. For example, our user may wish to withdraw money from an ATM, or engage in a purchase at a retail establishment. If so, she would begin in process 210 by unlocking her mobile device and activating the application. Techniques for unlocking mobile devices are known in the art, and generally require entry of a password, biometric data such as a fingerprint, or other information unique to the owner or user. Activating the application may include selecting an icon on a menu screen, for example, or entering a secondary password. The secondary password may be a fixed PIN assigned by the financial institution. In process 220, our user may enter into her mobile device a withdrawal or sales amount and any other data required by the transaction. In one embodiment, the mobile device uses location awareness (for example, the location of the device as determined by a GPS device) to transmit its current location or the location of the nearest ATM. In process 230, her mobile device sends a request containing these data to her financial institution for approval. Transmission of the request may be done using a data communications network known in the art, such as a cellular telephone data network. In process 240, a computer system of the financial institution processes the request to determine whether to approve the request. To make this determination, the financial institution may use the user's available balance, whether her credit card has expired, whether a fraud hold has been placed on her account, and any other information according to techniques known in the art.\"), (22, \"In process 250, the computer system makes a determination whether the request is approved. If not, it sends a rejection to the user's mobile device in process 260 using the data communications network. In a typical embodiment, a reason will be sent as well, and this rejection will manifest as an error screen in the transactional software application. In addition, if the request included location data, the financial institution may inform any nearby or indicated transactional device of the rejection in process 262, thereby preventing the user from transacting using these devices.\"), (23, 'If the request is approved, in process 270 the financial institution updates its database with a transactional PIN. This PIN may be used only for a single transaction, or series of related transactions, and may not be reused. It is therefore generated, as part of process 270, as a random or pseudo-random number using techniques known in the art. It may also be given an expiration time, so that it may not be used after that time. This time is pre-specified; that is, it is specified in advance of the actual transaction.'), (24, 'Once the transactional PIN has been stored in the database, in process 272 the computer system sends the PIN to the mobile device. This may be done using SMS or other texting system, as known in the art. Finally, the user receives the PIN on her mobile device in process 274. The transactional software application decrypts this PIN, if necessary, and stores it for later use. The actual transaction may not occur for some time, but it must commence before the expiration of the pre-specified expiration time. This delay between preparation and execution is useful, for example, if a user wishes to obtain her PIN while standing in line at an ATM or in a check-out line at a retailer. In such situations, the pre-specified expiration time may be very soon, for example five minutes in the future. This short expiration time advantageously prevents PIN collisions, as well as preventing multiple uses of the same PIN at later times.'), (25, \"In some embodiments, the PIN is encrypted using an encryption key that is uniquely associated with the mobile device before it is transmitted to the mobile device in process 272. For example, the transactional software application may have established an asymmetric encryption/decryption key pair, storing the decryption key locally (and securely, for example in a hardware smartcard) on the mobile device and transmitting the encryption key to the financial institution. In such a situation, the indicated encryption is performed using the transmitted encryption key, which may be stored in the financial institution's database. Or the application itself may have been generated by the financial institution with a decryption key as part of its program code, with the financial institution storing a corresponding encryption key. In the latter case, no cryptographic keys need be transmitted over a network at all.\"), (26, 'FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for using a PIN in a particular transaction. In process 310, the user approaches the transactional device, and inserts her physical token. For example, this may include her inserting a debit card (physical token) into an ATM machine (transactional device). In process 320, the user enters her transactional PIN code upon request from the transactional device. In some embodiments, the user keys in the received PIN. However, in other embodiments, the PIN request itself may be made to the mobile device using a short-range wireless network, such as a near-field communications network or a wireless cellular telephone network. Thus, in some embodiments, the transactional device includes a NFC transceiver or a low-cost picocell wireless transceiver. Entry of the transactional PIN in this embodiment need not be by touch pad; the local wireless network is sufficient. Thus, entry of the PIN may be accomplished by holding the mobile device up to the transactional device. In some embodiments, the mobile device will be already in range of the transceiver, and may transmit the PIN directly and automatically, without mechanical entry at all.'), (27, \"In process 330, the transactional device sends the received PIN and token data to the financial institution for approval of the transaction. In process 340, the financial institution determines if the transaction may proceed. This determination includes matching the transactional PIN to the token data (e.g., credit card number) of the user. Typically, it will do so by consulting the database, in which are stored the transactional PIN, the expiration time, and the user's account information. The financial institution may use other information, such as her current balance, to make this determination.\"), (28, 'In process 350, the computer system determines whether the transaction is allowed to proceed. If not, in process 360 a rejection is sent to the transactional device. The transactional device then notifies the user of the rejection in process 362. For example, an ATM may show the user a “not enough cash” screen. If the rejection is caused by a mismatch between the PIN and the physical token, then the financial institution may infer that fraud is taking place. In such situations, the user may be given a false reason for rejection to avoid arousing suspicion. Simultaneously, the date, time, and location of the failed transaction may be stored by the financial institution for later use. In an ATM embodiment, this data may be correlated to security footage taken from a built-in camera at that location to obtain a picture of the person entering the bad PIN. In some cases, an image of the user can be compared against a known image of the account holder, and if the two do not match, the financial institution may give law enforcement the captured image.'), (29, 'If the transaction is permitted, in process 370 an approval message is sent to the transactional device and the physical token is thereby finally authenticated. Thus, the user has been authenticated, and is now authorized to perform transactions using the transactional device. In process 372, the transactional device performs one or more transactions with the user. In process 374, the transactional device sends the results of these transactions to the financial institution for recordation and post-transaction processing as is known in the art. Finally, in process 376, the financial institution invalidates the transactional PIN, preventing it from being further used. In some embodiments, this last process is performed even if the pre-specified time has not yet passed, forcing the user to activate her transactional software application yet again to obtain a new transactional PIN. This extra process is taken because the user has concluded the transaction for which the first PIN was assigned—even if she has made a mistake and needs to correct it by re-authenticating, the system may consider this a new transaction for which a new transactional PIN is required.'), (30, 'The embodiments of the invention described above are intended to be merely exemplary; numerous variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention as defined in any appended claims.'), (31, 'It should be noted that the logic flow diagrams are used herein to demonstrate various aspects of the invention, and should not be construed to limit the present invention to any particular logic flow or logic implementation. The described logic may be partitioned into different logic blocks (e.g., programs, modules, functions, or subroutines) without changing the overall results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the invention. Often times, logic elements may be added, modified, omitted, performed in a different order, or implemented using different logic constructs (e.g., logic gates, looping primitives, conditional logic, and other logic constructs) without changing the overall results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the invention.'), (32, 'The present invention may be embodied in many different forms, including, but in no way limited to, computer program logic for use with a processor (e.g., a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, or general purpose computer), programmable logic for use with a programmable logic device (e.g., a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or other PLD), discrete components, integrated circuitry (e.g., an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)), or any other means including any combination thereof.'), (33, 'Computer program logic implementing all or part of the functionality previously described herein may be embodied in various forms, including, but in no way limited to, a source code form, a computer executable form, and various intermediate forms (e.g., forms generated by an assembler, compiler, linker, or locator).

      "1 The system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet utilizes a delivery box having a front door with an electronic lock and electronic key reader for receipt of goods ordered via the Internet. Goods are shipped in a transport box having an interior space and a device for controlling the temperature within the interior space. The delivery box has at least one interior transport box receptacle where a transport box containing goods is placed on delivery. A power and data interface is established between a delivery box control circuit and a transport box control circuit. The transport box is placed into one of the receptacles, so that the delivery box control circuit can power the transport box control circuit and environment-controlling device.

      "28 In process 350, the computer system determines whether the transaction is allowed to proceed. If not, in process 360 a rejection is sent to the transactional device. The transactional device then notifies the user of the rejection in process 362. For example, an ATM may show the user a “not enough cash” screen. If the rejection is caused by a mismatch between the PIN and the physical token, then the financial institution may infer that fraud is taking place. In such situations, the user may be given a false reason for rejection to avoid arousing suspicion. Simultaneously, the date, time, and location of the failed transaction may be stored by the financial institution for later use. In an ATM embodiment, this data may be correlated to security footage taken from a built-in camera at that location to obtain a picture of the person entering the bad PIN. In some cases, an image of the user can be compared against a known image of the account holder, and if the two do not match, the financial institution may give law enforcement the captured image.\n",

      "6 The Internet has opened a vast electronic frontier for consumers, enabling the consumers to shop, from the convenience and comfort of their own home or business, among countless providers of all types of goods. Electronic commerce, merged with the Internet and the World Wide Web, facilitates the purchase of goods by integrating a variety of payment services so that, after browsing the Web and browsing merchant websites, goods may be purchased essentially with the click of a button. \n",
      "\n",
      "21 FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction. For example, our user may wish to withdraw money from an ATM, or engage in a purchase at a retail establishment. If so, she would begin in process 210 by unlocking her mobile device and activating the application. Techniques for unlocking mobile devices are known in the art, and generally require entry of a password, biometric data such as a fingerprint, or other information unique to the owner or user. Activating the application may include selecting an icon on a menu screen, for example, or entering a secondary password. The secondary password may be a fixed PIN assigned by the financial institution. In process 220, our user may enter into her mobile device a withdrawal or sales amount and any other data required by the transaction. In one embodiment, the mobile device uses location awareness (for example, the location of the device as determined by a GPS device) to transmit its current location or the location of the nearest ATM. In process 230, her mobile device sends a request containing these data to her financial institution for approval. Transmission of the request may be done using a data communications network known in the art, such as a cellular telephone data network. In process 240, a computer system of the financial institution processes the request to determine whether to approve the request. To make this determination, the financial institution may use the user's available balance, whether her credit card has expired, whether a fraud hold has been placed on her account, and any other information according to techniques known in the art.\n",
      "----\n",
      "7 Once an order for goods has been placed with an Internet merchant, the goods of course must be delivered to the customer. While conventional forms of delivery, including the U.S. mail, express and overnight delivery services and other forms of mail and package delivery, and other common delivery and shipping methods and services, suffice for many items ordered on the Internet, some items require special handling for proper delivery. Food or other perishable items may require special care, such as maintenance of proper temperatures during delivery and after delivery if the food items delivered are left unattended. High value items may require special handling for security, or will require insurance against the loss or theft of the items during the course of delivery. The lack of a delivery service specialized to accommodate special handling for some goods may discourage a vibrant Internet marketplace for the goods if customers are concerned about receiving goods in good condition (such as frozen food items that may arrive thawed) or if Internet merchants or their customers must bear excessive costs to insure goods for delivery. Additionally, delivery of some goods is hampered if the recipient is not present to receive the goods, since shippers and merchants are reluctant to have certain goods left unattended. \n",
      "\n",
      "31 It should be noted that the logic flow diagrams are used herein to demonstrate various aspects of the invention, and should not be construed to limit the present invention to any particular logic flow or logic implementation. The described logic may be partitioned into different logic blocks (e.g., programs, modules, functions, or subroutines) without changing the overall results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the invention. Often times, logic elements may be added, modified, omitted, performed in a different order, or implemented using different logic constructs (e.g., logic gates, looping primitives, conditional logic, and other logic constructs) without changing the overall results or otherwise departing from the true scope of the invention.\n",
      "----\n",
      "8 Various receptacles have been employed to receive delivered goods. An example is a locked mailbox with a delivery slot that allows letters or very small packages to be inserted into the mailbox, and only removed by a recipient with a key. This provides a degree of security for the letters and small packages, but does not prevent receipt of unwanted items. Additionally, provision for maintaining an environmental condition is lacking. Larger lock boxes have been devised to overcome package size limitations. However, no known lock box addresses all phases of delivery of goods to provide security and proper handling of goods with special needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "12 Advantageously, the invention may be embodied without any change to existing ATM hardware. Also, ATM transactions work unchanged, and no slow down is experienced by the customer. A software change is required, but only at the financial institution. On the customer's end, a user only has to install a new application on their mobile device (such as a smartphone). Banks already provide small screen-enabled websites and smartphone applications for mobile devices. It is contemplated that this invention may be embodied as another such application. Further, such a system may be used with all types of credit or debit card transactions, not just those at ATMs.\n",
      "----\n",
      "9 Thus, a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet solving the aforementioned problems is desired. \n",
      "\n",
      "22 In process 250, the computer system makes a determination whether the request is approved. If not, it sends a rejection to the user's mobile device in process 260 using the data communications network. In a typical embodiment, a reason will be sent as well, and this rejection will manifest as an error screen in the transactional software application. In addition, if the request included location data, the financial institution may inform any nearby or indicated transactional device of the rejection in process 262, thereby preventing the user from transacting using these devices.\n",
      "----\n",
      "10 The system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet employs a delivery box for receiving goods ordered via the Internet, and transport boxes for delivery of goods requiring special handling during delivery. The delivery box has at least one inner bay for receiving a transport box containing delivered goods. The transport box may include means for providing for special handling requirements of goods, such as a lock that interacts with the delivery box such that the transport box may only be opened upon delivery or by an authorized delivery person, or means for maintaining an environmental parameter, such as a cold or a warm temperature, for proper storage during delivery of goods that have particular environmental needs. \n",

To gain access into the delivery box, a delivery person must therefore have an appropriately matching coded key, or must know a correct cipher lock code. A unique code is assigned for each delivery, helping to ensure that access to the delivery box is only obtained by a delivery person making an expected delivery, and facilitating tracking of the order. \n",

      "7 Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for authenticating a physical token as part of initiation of a commercial credit or debit transaction. The physical token may be a credit card or debit card having a magnetic stripe in which are stored data pertaining to a credit account or a debit account. The transaction is implemented using a transactional device, such as an ATM or point-of-sale device having a magnetic stripe reader.\n",

Along with the delivery code, delivery instructions are generated that include an identification number or code for the destination delivery box, time and place for delivery, handling instructions (such as a requirement to keep frozen foods cold) and security instructions. The ordered goods are placed into a transport box that is configured according to the delivery instructions, such as providing a transport box with refrigerating capability for frozen foods. Delivery instructions may be downloaded to the transport box and the delivery box, for example, to set a holding temperature to maintain the goods or to deliver GPS coordinates for the delivery location. \n",
      "\n",
      "1 Systems and methods are provided to prevent unauthorized credit and debit transactions. A system creates a transactional, or one-time-use PIN in response to a request from a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, belonging to an authorized user. This PIN is securely transmitted to the mobile device, and used in combination with a credit or debit account number to complete the transaction. The user is determined to be authorized by the fact that they are able to access an application on the mobile device that sends the request. The application itself may be protected using a non-changing PIN.\n",
      "----\n",
      "14 The Internet merchant provides to a delivery person or service means for accessing the customer's delivery box, by providing a programmable keycard or other electronic key device, or providing a cipher lock code, or the like. Delivery access code information may be provided via a secure server over the Internet from the Internet merchant, who produces the corresponding keycard at the time of paid order confirmation, to the delivery service. The electronic key device bearing the access code is used upon delivery, and may be left with the delivered goods as a receipt. \n",

      "15 On delivery of the goods to the delivery site, a delivery person uses the electronic key device to gain access into the delivery box, placing the goods into the delivery box. A transport box may interact with the delivery box to perform security functions, or to receive power from the delivery box to ensure continuation of environmental parameters or other settings maintained by the transport box. The transport box, equipped with a GPS, may compare the actual location with the expected delivery location to verify that the goods have been properly delivered. A mismatch causes an alarm, such as illuminating an indicator light or generating a service warning. In the case of high value goods, a mismatch may disable a lock on the transport box, preventing access to the goods within. This serves both to enhance security of deliveries of high value goods, and to prevent accidental erroneous deliveries when a delivery person, carrying multiple transport boxes, places the wrong transport box into a delivery box. \n",

While some groups in Europe have installed smartcards into their plastic credit and debit cards to prevent card duplication, this does not prevent a thief who skims a PIN from stealing the physical card (perhaps, by waiting around the corner from the ATM machine). The thief will still be able to drain the user's bank account if he acts quickly, before the user has an opportunity to report that the card has been stolen.\n",

For example, our user may wish to withdraw money from an ATM, or engage in a purchase at a retail establishment. If so, she would begin in process 210 by unlocking her mobile device and activating the application. Techniques for unlocking mobile devices are known in the art, and generally require entry of a password, biometric data such as a fingerprint, or other information unique to the owner or user. Activating the application may include selecting an icon on a menu screen, for example, or entering a secondary password. The secondary password may be a fixed PIN assigned by the financial institution. In process 220, our user may enter into her mobile device a withdrawal or sales amount and any other data required by the transaction. In one embodiment, the mobile device uses location awareness (for example, the location of the device as determined by a GPS device) to transmit its current location or the location of the nearest ATM. In process 230, her mobile device sends a request containing these data to her financial institution for approval. Transmission of the request may be done using a data communications network known in the art, such as a cellular telephone data network. In process 240, a computer system of the financial institution processes the request to determine whether to approve the request. To make this determination, the financial institution may use the user's available balance, whether her credit card has expired, whether a fraud hold has been placed on her account, and any other information according to techniques known in the art.\n",

In process 310, the user approaches the transactional device, and inserts her physical token. For example, this may include her inserting a debit card (physical token) into an ATM machine (transactional device). In process 320, the user enters her transactional PIN code upon request from the transactional device. In some embodiments, the user keys in the received PIN. However, in other embodiments, the PIN request itself may be made to the mobile device using a short-range wireless network, such as a near-field communications network or a wireless cellular telephone network. Thus, in some embodiments, the transactional device includes a NFC transceiver or a low-cost picocell wireless transceiver. Entry of the transactional PIN in this embodiment need not be by touch pad; the local wireless network is sufficient. Thus, entry of the PIN may be accomplished by holding the mobile device up to the transactional device. In some embodiments, the mobile device will be already in range of the transceiver, and may transmit the PIN directly and automatically, without mechanical entry at all.\n",

      "4 Skimming is commonly defined as the theft of credit or debit card information used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. For example, thieves may skim card numbers by installing credit card readers and/or false keyboards and cameras in an ATM machine. The theft occurs when an unsuspecting user inserts a credit or debit card into the compromised reader, which copies the information on the card. The user then enters their personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM keypad. The PIN is captured by camera, or for ATMs with out touch screens, by an overlay device installed over or in the ATM keypad. Using a magnetic card writer, a commonly available device, the thieves duplicate the information from the card's magnetic stripe onto a dummy card. They then use the dummy card and stolen PIN in an ATM machine (or other point-of-sale device) to empty the user's bank account or make illegal purchases. Skimmers have targeted many ATMs, even some installed inside bank premises.\n",

In one embodiment, the mobile device uses location awareness (for example, the location of the device as determined by a GPS device) to transmit its current location or the location of the nearest ATM. In process 230, her mobile device sends a request containing these data to her financial institution for approval. Transmission of the request may be done using a data communications network known in the art, such as a cellular telephone data network. In process 240, a computer system of the financial institution processes the request to determine whether to approve the request. To make this determination, the financial institution may use the user's available balance, whether her credit card has expired, whether a fraud hold has been placed on her account, and any other information according to techniques known in the art.\n",

      "43 Turning now to FIGS. 7-10, a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet is described, the method employing a delivery box 100, a transport box 200, and the system briefly described in FIG. 6. The method may be embodied in a computer program executing on an Internet merchant server 14, and in programming of the control circuit 150 in the delivery box and programming of the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200. In such an embodiment, the computer program generally functions as a Web service to provide customer interface functions to a client program such as an Internet browser functioning on a customer computer 12. \n",

      "22 In process 250, the computer system makes a determination whether the request is approved. If not, it sends a rejection to the user's mobile device in process 260 using the data communications network. In a typical embodiment, a reason will be sent as well, and this rejection will manifest as an error screen in the transactional software application. In addition, if the request included location data, the financial institution may inform any nearby or indicated transactional device of the rejection in process 262, thereby preventing the user from transacting using these devices.\n",
      "----\n",
      "44 A method for entering an order by a customer is described in FIG. 7. A customer begins the process by browsing the Internet 20, and particularly a merchant Web site, to locate goods for purchase (step 702). With goods selected, an order is entered (step 704), identifying a delivery address for the customer, or the location of the delivery box 100 indicated by the GPS 151, and identifying the customer's delivery box 100. The order entry includes completion of a payment transaction, wherein the customer enters payment information such as a credit card number or appropriate identification for another online payment service. \n",

      "21 FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction. For example, our user may wish to withdraw money from an ATM, or engage in a purchase at a retail establishment. If so, she would begin in process 210 by unlocking her mobile device and activating the application. Techniques for unlocking mobile devices are known in the art, and generally require entry of a password, biometric data such as a fingerprint, or other information unique to the owner or user. Activating the application may include selecting an icon on a menu screen, for example, or entering a secondary password. The secondary password may be a fixed PIN assigned by the financial institution. In process 220, our user may enter into her mobile device a withdrawal or sales amount and any other data required by the transaction.

      "45 Once the order is entered, and payment confirmed, a unique delivery or access code is generated (step 706), and a keycard 105 is generated containing the delivery or access code. The delivery code will function as a security code for delivery access to the delivery box 100, and also may be used to track the order. Note that separate security and tracking codes may be used. Codes are preferably encrypted for distribution, over the Internet, to the merchant and the delivery box 100. Delivery instructions are then generated (step 708). The delivery instructions may include electronic delivery instructions that are downloadable into the delivery box 100 and into a transport box 200, identifying special handling for the goods that will be supported by the delivery box 100 and transport box 200. \n",

      "1 Systems and methods are provided to prevent unauthorized credit and debit transactions. A system creates a transactional, or one-time-use PIN in response to a request from a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, belonging to an authorized user. This PIN is securely transmitted to the mobile device, and used in combination with a credit or debit account number to complete the transaction. The user is determined to be authorized by the fact that they are able to access an application on the mobile device that sends the request. The application itself may be protected using a non-changing PIN.\n",

      "46 In the above, additional security may be provided by the usage of additional wireless or hardwired sensors. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a wireless tag, such as a radio frequency ID (RFID) chip 300 may be embedded within keycard 105. Alternatively, such a wireless tag may be carried by the delivery person, RFID chip 300 (or any other wireless transmitter) includes either the same access code or a secondary access code, which is transmitted and received by a wireless sensor 302, mounted on the interior of door 102, or mounted in any other suitable location within the system. In order to access the interior, the delivery person needs to swipe the keycard 105, which has the proper access code encoded thereon, and also have the wireless tag 300. Alternatively, a wired system may be utilized. Sensor 302 is in communication with controller 250. \n",

      "26 FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for using a PIN in a particular transaction. In process 310, the user approaches the transactional device, and inserts her physical token. For example, this may include her inserting a debit card (physical token) into an ATM machine (transactional device). In process 320, the user enters her transactional PIN code upon request from the transactional device. In some embodiments, the user keys in the received PIN. However, in other embodiments, the PIN request itself may be made to the mobile device using a short-range wireless network, such as a near-field communications network or a wireless cellular telephone network. Thus, in some embodiments, the transactional device includes a NFC transceiver or a low-cost picocell wireless transceiver. Entry of the transactional PIN in this embodiment need not be by touch pad; the local wireless network is sufficient. Thus, entry of the PIN may be accomplished by holding the mobile device up to the transactional device. In some embodiments, the mobile device will be already in range of the transceiver, and may transmit the PIN directly and automatically, without mechanical entry at all.\n",
      "----\n",
      "47 Additionally, a similar sensor 304 (as shown in FIG. 1) may be mounted on the interior side of the system, requiring the interior, household user to also have an encoded wireless tag. Further, as shown in FIG. 3, a computer port 306, such as a USB port or the like, may be incorporated in the internal door 110, with sensor 304 and USB port 306 also being in communication with controller 250. In order to access the interior, the user needs to have the properly encoded wireless tag, along with a portable device or computer, also having an encrypted code stored thereon, which is transmitted to controller 250 via port 306. It should be understood that any suitable type of sensor may be utilized, and any suitable type of computer interface may also be utilized. The wireless sensors and USB port shown in the Figures are shown for exemplary purposes only. \n",

      "12 Advantageously, the invention may be embodied without any change to existing ATM hardware. Also, ATM transactions work unchanged, and no slow down is experienced by the customer. A software change is required, but only at the financial institution. On the customer's end, a user only has to install a new application on their mobile device (such as a smartphone). Banks already provide small screen-enabled websites and smartphone applications for mobile devices. It is contemplated that this invention may be embodied as another such application. Further, such a system may be used with all types of credit or debit card transactions, not just those at ATMs.\n",

The delivery instructions may also include a due date or time, or an expiration time for the order. The order, security code, and delivery instructions are forwarded to the merchant or a warehouse facility 16 for fulfillment of the order (step 710), and are forwarded to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 712). \n",

The order is fulfilled (step 804) by identifying the ordered goods, and preparing them for shipment. With reference to the order and delivery instructions, the merchant or warehouse facility determines if a transport box 200 will be needed for delivery of the goods (step 806). If the goods require a controlled environment or temperature during shipping, or if the delivery instructions require special security for the goods, a transport box 200 is used. The transport box 200 is prepared by downloading the security code and delivery instructions to the transport box 200, the delivery instructions being stored within the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200 (step 808). The goods are packed into the transport box and the transport box is electromechanically locked (step 810). The goods are then delivered to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 812). \n",

      "50 During the course of transport for delivery, the transport box 200 maintains a proper temperature for holding the goods. Additionally, the transport box 200 control circuit 250 may monitor the GPS 252 to determine if the transport box 200 has been transported outside of a pre-determined geographic area, indicated in the delivery instructions, such that the transport box 200 may have been stolen, misrouted, or mishandled. An alert may be forwarded by the transport box 200, by wireless connection to the Internet, to the merchant, shipper, or customer. \n",

If the rejection is caused by a mismatch between the PIN and the physical token, then the financial institution may infer that fraud is taking place. In such situations, the user may be given a false reason for rejection to avoid arousing suspicion.

      "52 If a valid security code is read, an order stored by the control circuit 150 is retrieved (step 906) along with the delivery instructions for the order. The order may be accepted or rejected (at 908) depending on whether or not the delivery of goods complies with the delivery instructions. For example, delivery instructions for an order may have specified a delivery deadline that has been missed. If the order is rejected, a notification is sent to the vendor (or shipper) (step 916), and the customer may be notified (at 918). If the order is accepted, the control circuit 150 commands the electronic lock 104 to open (step 910), allowing access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. On entry to the delivery box 100, the delivery person may find an old transport box 200 left over from a previous delivery, in which case the old transport box 200 is removed for return to the merchant or shipper (step 911). If the delivered goods are packaged in a transport box 200, the transport box 200 is placed into a transport box receptacle 122 (step 912) within the delivery box 100, whereupon the electrical contacts 208 on the transport box 200 are brought into contact with the electrical contacts 124 of the transport box receptacle 122.

In some configurations, the customer will be required to enter a security code to gain access to the goods within the delivery box 100. In a delivery box 100 having only front door 102 for access, for example, the customer will need to enter a code to unlock the door. Similarly, if a second door 110 is configured with an electronic lock such as electronic cipher lock 112, a security code may be required for the customer to gain entry. If a security code is required (at step 1004), the customer enters the code and the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 reads the security code. If a valid code is entered, the control circuit 150 allows the customer to open a door for removal of the goods. If the goods are not in a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016) once a door is open for delivery. If the goods are contained within a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be retained until the transport box 200 is removed from its transport box receptacle 122. If the transport box 200 is not timely removed from the transport box receptacle 122 after the delivery box 100 is opened by the customer (determined at 1014), a reminder may be generated to notify the customer (step 1012). Once the transport box is removed, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016). \n",

As one example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where an image of the customer is captured for every cash-based transaction, regardless of the transaction amount. As another example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish security rules where the at least one transaction parameter captured from the customer becomes progressively more restrictive as the triggering transaction amount increases. As an even further example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where biometric data is captured from the customer during the transaction, communicated to the transaction security server for verification, and a confirmation signal is received from the transaction security server before approving the transaction. Other security rules can be selected and established based on the needs of the user 125, legal requirements, developing business practices, and the like. As can be appreciated, the user 125 can establish a wide variety of differing security rules that vary based on the selection of, for example, the type of transaction, the value involved in the transaction, developing industry standards, and the like. As can be further appreciated, the user 125 can dynamically edit, delete, or establish security rules dependent on varying business or social conditions.

In general, software tracing involves subjecting a device thought to contain traced software to a specified operation, hereinafter referred to as a trace trigger, such that a trace message (i.e. any unambiguous characterization of the presence of the traced software) will only be correctly issued if the traced software is present. \n",
      "\n",
      "12 A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the following drawings. In the appended figures, similar components or features may have the same reference label. Further, various components of the same type may be distinguished by following the reference label by a dash and a second label that distinguishes among the similar components. If only the first reference label is used in the specification, the description is applicable to any one of the similar components having the same first reference label irrespective of the second reference label.\n",
      "----\n",
      "4 As a specific example, consider the case where the traced software component is a video decoder. For software tracing purposes, the traced software component may include a mechanism, whereby when a specific video stream is input for playback, a trace message is correctly displayed on a device only if the video decoder therein comprises the traced software. Otherwise, a different result, irrespective of what that is, will indicate that the video decoder does not comprise the traced software. \n",
      "\n",
      "5 Furthermore, the user is typically limited to security rules established by, for example, credit card issuing companies. As is understood, a credit card issuing company typically establishes a rule that no identification is required for card-based transactions below a de minimis dollar amount. Beyond that dollar amount, the company requires a signature or a personal identification number (PIN) to serve as the customer's identification component. The user can request some form of identification to confirm that the signatures/name matches. However, such credit card issuing company rules do not help the user prevent fraud when the transaction is cash-based and, further, do not permit the user to establish its own security rules that can be applied to transactions of varying amounts or types.\n",
      "----\n",
      "5 In another example, US Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0233547 describes a mechanism whereby when a software program is legally downloaded (under license) from a server and installed on a user's machine, the authorized user's machine is allocated a unique identification number and this identification number is embedded one or more times within the copy of the software program downloaded thereto. A Client Program is provided which, whenever the software program is to be executed, compares the identification number of the machine on which it is being run with the identification number embedded in the software program and will only permit execution of the software program if the two numbers match. Thus, if a further copy of the software program is illegally provided to another user's machine, it will not run thereon because the identification number embedded in the software program will not match the identification number assigned to the user's machine. Furthermore, the original user can be traced through the identification number embedded in the software program. \n",
      "\n",
      "34 Accordingly, the user 125 can utilize the point-of-transaction device 105 to establish a wide variety of security rules to be applied to differing transactions. As one example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where an image of the customer is captured for every cash-based transaction, regardless of the transaction amount. As another example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish security rules where the at least one transaction parameter captured from the customer becomes progressively more restrictive as the triggering transaction amount increases. As an even further example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where biometric data is captured from the customer during the transaction, communicated to the transaction security server for verification, and a confirmation signal is received from the transaction security server before approving the transaction. Other security rules can be selected and established based on the needs of the user 125, legal requirements, developing business practices, and the like. As can be appreciated, the user 125 can establish a wide variety of differing security rules that vary based on the selection of, for example, the type of transaction, the value involved in the transaction, developing industry standards, and the like. As can be further appreciated, the user 125 can dynamically edit, delete, or establish security rules dependent on varying business or social conditions. Thus, the user 125 is provided a great deal of flexibility to establish security rules that favor the prevention of fraud, theft, and the like.\n",

      "6 More generally, it is known to incorporate a trace message generator in the software component, wherein a trigger string is inserted into a compressed media content file and, when the media content file is played back by the software component, if the software component is not the traced software component, the trigger will be disregarded and the media content will be played back, whereas if the software component is the traced software component, the media decoder will recognize the trigger and cause a message generator to generate a specified trace message. However, the trace message file may be quite large, as will be the overhead due to the additional message generator, thereby increasing the overall overhead of the software component, which is not desirable. \n",

      "8 Most media data formats are comprised of (at least) a user data field and a content field, wherein it is possible for data to be “hidden” in the user data field because conformant decoders/parsers are mandated to ignore data in this field. Thus, the user data field might, under some circumstances, be considered to be an appropriate part of a media data file in which to include a trace trigger. However, some specific difficulties are envisaged in implementing software tracing in this manner in media processing components such as video and audio decoders. One of the main difficulties is that such components do not have “direct” access to the device screen so as to enable a textual trace message to be displayed. Media processing components can only output the media format they are designed to produce, for example, a video decoder can only produce images (YUV frames), a music player can only output sound (PCM frames), etc. Thus, although a “trigger” could be provided in the user data field, it is not a simple matter to implement a sufficiently selective and specific trace message output. \n",

      "43 The authentication rule records 155 may be electronic records stored in memory and including information related to predetermined rules for given transactions. Generally, it can be appreciated that restrictions exist relating to certain transaction types, amount, frequency, etc. For example, certain rules may prohibit or control the transfer of currency, or a predetermined amount of currency, in to or out of a particular geographic region. Other rules may prohibit or control the ability of certain customers 120 to participate in some transactions (e.g., prohibit a convicted felon from purchasing a gun). Even further, some rules may limit the frequency of transactions for a particular customer 120 within a given time period (e.g., the number of times a customer 120 may be distributed certain items or provisions). The authentication rule records 155 include information relating to such transaction rules which can be utilized for each transaction as an additional form of transaction security and fraud prevention.\n",

For example, the user may request some form of identification from the customer during a transaction. Typically, the user uses the proffered identification to confirm that the proof of identification corresponds to the customer, e.g., has the same name as appears on a credit card being used by the customer. However, the user typically cannot confirm that the proof of identification provided by the customer is authentic.\n",

In both cases, the content of the trace message is likely to consist of the version number, product and proprietary company, but the present invention is not necessarily intended to be limited in this regard. \n",

      "28 The type of encryption used to encrypt the trace message can be relatively primitive, since the single purpose thereof is to cause products that do not contain the traced software to be incapable of processing the media file. For example, XORING the trace message with an arbitrary bit stream (e.g. a symmetric key) which can be quite short, i.e. of a length most efficiently processed by the platform.

On the other hand, if the partially encrypted compressed trace message with trigger 20 is input to a device 26 including the traced software component, a trigger detector and descrambler 28 regenerates the compressed trace message 14 using the product key 18 and the trigger string 16 as inputs. The compressed trace message 14 is input to a standard media decoder 22 and the original trace message is output in the supported media format. \n",

      "32 As in the above exemplary embodiment, in conventional systems, media encryption is usually performed after compression because, if raw media is encrypted (or scrambled) the statistical properties of the raw media (on which the compression technologies rely) would be completely changed and the compression performances may thus be severely degraded. However, in the case of the present invention, only the specific trigger file will suffer from this problem and, because the trigger file is included in the media content file, rather than the software component, the size of this file is immaterial. \n",

The scrambled trace message 32 is input to a standard media encoder 12 and the resultant compressed scrambled trace message 34 is fed to a trigger insertion tool 36 which causes a trigger string 16 to be inserted, to generate a compressed trace message with trigger file 38, which is a standard valid file. This file 38 is incorporated in the content field of a media content file to be input into the standard media decoder 22 of a target device. If the tested device 24 does not contain the traced software component, the media content may be correctly played back, or not, but the trace message 42 will be scrambled. On the other hand, if the tested device 26 does contain the traced software component, the scrambled trace message 32 is regenerated by the standard media decoder 22 using the trigger string 16, and a content descrambler 40 is caused to descramble the scrambled trace message 32 using the product key 18, in response to the detected trigger 33, so as to output the trace message 10. \n",

A font file does not contain the letters or sounds of the trace message themselves, but a collection of instructions that the traced software component can interpret to actually generate the trace message. Thus, a “font” can be defined herein as a collection of patterns (graphical in the case of video and sound in the case of audio) where each pattern corresponds to a text fragment (i.e. a character, word or sentence). \n",

As one example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where an image of the customer is captured for every cash-based transaction, regardless of the transaction amount. As another example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish security rules where the at least one transaction parameter captured from the customer becomes progressively more restrictive as the triggering transaction amount increases. As an even further example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where biometric data is captured from the customer during the transaction, communicated to the transaction security server for verification, and a confirmation signal is received from the transaction security server before approving the transaction. Other security rules can be selected and established based on the needs of the user 125, legal requirements, developing business practices, and the like. As can be appreciated, the user 125 can establish a wide variety of differing security rules that vary based on the selection of, for example, the type of transaction, the value involved in the transaction, developing industry standards, and the like. As can be further appreciated, the user 125 can dynamically edit, delete, or establish security rules dependent on varying business or social conditions.

As before, the media format may be fully or partially encrypted, which is useful if it is desirable that a product not containing the traced software will not be able to process the incoming media content file at all. The trace trigger media content file contains the trace message minimal font, which forms the basis for generation of the correct trace message according to the version number of the traced software. \n",

      "5 Furthermore, the user is typically limited to security rules established by, for example, credit card issuing companies. As is understood, a credit card issuing company typically establishes a rule that no identification is required for card-based transactions below a de minimis dollar amount. Beyond that dollar amount, the company requires a signature or a personal identification number (PIN) to serve as the customer's identification component. The user can request some form of identification to confirm that the signatures/name matches. However, such credit card issuing company rules do not help the user prevent fraud when the transaction is cash-based and, further, do not permit the user to establish its own security rules that can be applied to transactions of varying amounts or types.\n",

This is not a valid standard content file. Thus, if it is input to the standard media decoder of a device 24 not having the traced software component, an error will occur. On the other hand, if the file 58 is input to a device 24 incorporating the traced software component, a trigger detector 60 detects the trigger string in the user data field and uses the trigger string 16 and product key 18 as inputs to regenerate the compressed font message 62. The compressed font message 62 and data representative of the version number 64 of the traced software are then used as inputs to a character generator 66 (or “trace message generator”) for generating a trace message in the desired file format. \n",
