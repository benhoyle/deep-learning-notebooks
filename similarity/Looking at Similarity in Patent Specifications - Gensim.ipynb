An example is a locked mailbox with a delivery slot that allows letters or very small packages to be inserted into the mailbox, and only removed by a recipient with a key. This provides a degree of security for the letters and small packages, but does not prevent receipt of unwanted items. Additionally, provision for maintaining an environmental condition is lacking. Larger lock boxes have been devised to overcome package size limitations. However, no known lock box addresses all phases of delivery of goods to provide security and proper handling of goods with special needs."

       "[1 The system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet utilizes a delivery box having a front door with an electronic lock and electronic key reader for receipt of goods ordered via the Internet. Goods are shipped in a transport box having an interior space and a device for controlling the temperature within the interior space. The delivery box has at least one interior transport box receptacle where a transport box containing goods is placed on delivery. A power and data interface is established between a delivery box control circuit and a transport box control circuit. The transport box is placed into one of the receptacles, so that the delivery box control circuit can power the transport box control circuit and environment-controlling device. A security code is downloaded from an Internet merchant site to the delivery box and stored onto a keycard when an order is placed.,\n",
       " 2 This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/379,771, filed Feb. 27, 2009.,\n",
       " 3 1. Field of the Invention,\n",
       " 4 The present invention relates to the delivery of goods purchased via Internet-based electronic commerce and, more particularly, to a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet.,\n",
       " 5 2. Description of the Related Art,\n",
       " 6 The Internet has opened a vast electronic frontier for consumers, enabling the consumers to shop, from the convenience and comfort of their own home or business, among countless providers of all types of goods. Electronic commerce, merged with the Internet and the World Wide Web, facilitates the purchase of goods by integrating a variety of payment services so that, after browsing the Web and browsing merchant websites, goods may be purchased essentially with the click of a button.,\n",
       " 7 Once an order for goods has been placed with an Internet merchant, the goods of course must be delivered to the customer. While conventional forms of delivery, including the U.S. mail, express and overnight delivery services and other forms of mail and package delivery, and other common delivery and shipping methods and services, suffice for many items ordered on the Internet, some items require special handling for proper delivery. Food or other perishable items may require special care, such as maintenance of proper temperatures during delivery and after delivery if the food items delivered are left unattended. High value items may require special handling for security, or will require insurance against the loss or theft of the items during the course of delivery. The lack of a delivery service specialized to accommodate special handling for some goods may discourage a vibrant Internet marketplace for the goods if customers are concerned about receiving goods in good condition (such as frozen food items that may arrive thawed) or if Internet merchants or their customers must bear excessive costs to insure goods for delivery. Additionally, delivery of some goods is hampered if the recipient is not present to receive the goods, since shippers and merchants are reluctant to have certain goods left unattended.,\n",
       " 8 Various receptacles have been employed to receive delivered goods. An example is a locked mailbox with a delivery slot that allows letters or very small packages to be inserted into the mailbox, and only removed by a recipient with a key. This provides a degree of security for the letters and small packages, but does not prevent receipt of unwanted items. Additionally, provision for maintaining an environmental condition is lacking. Larger lock boxes have been devised to overcome package size limitations. However, no known lock box addresses all phases of delivery of goods to provide security and proper handling of goods with special needs.,\n",
       " 9 Thus, a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet solving the aforementioned problems is desired.,\n",
       " 10 The system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet employs a delivery box for receiving goods ordered via the Internet, and transport boxes for delivery of goods requiring special handling during delivery. The delivery box has at least one inner bay for receiving a transport box containing delivered goods. The transport box may include means for providing for special handling requirements of goods, such as a lock that interacts with the delivery box such that the transport box may only be opened upon delivery or by an authorized delivery person, or means for maintaining an environmental parameter, such as a cold or a warm temperature, for proper storage during delivery of goods that have particular environmental needs.,\n",
       " 11 The delivery box has at least one secure door for access to the interior of the delivery box, and may have a second door for access in a pass-through fashion. In one embodiment, the delivery box is configured for through-wall mounting, having a secure outside door and an inside door such that goods are delivered into the delivery box through the secure outside door, and are removed by the customer through the inside door.,\n",
       " 12 Access through the secure door is controlled by an electronic lock, in conjunction with a user key interface that may be a keycard reader, an electronic cipher lock, a radio frequency identification (RFID) key reader, or another similar electronic lock and key arrangement. To gain access into the delivery box, a delivery person must therefore have an appropriately matching coded key, or must know a correct cipher lock code. A unique code is assigned for each delivery, helping to ensure that access to the delivery box is only obtained by a delivery person making an expected delivery, and facilitating tracking of the order.,\n",
       " 13 The delivery box is in communication with the Internet such that when a customer places an order to purchase goods using the Internet, a unique delivery code associated with the purchase order is created and delivered both to the delivery box and with the purchase order to the Internet merchant, the delivery code being encrypted for security. Along with the delivery code, delivery instructions are generated that include an identification number or code for the destination delivery box, time and place for delivery, handling instructions (such as a requirement to keep frozen foods cold) and security instructions. The ordered goods are placed into a transport box that is configured according to the delivery instructions, such as providing a transport box with refrigerating capability for frozen foods. Delivery instructions may be downloaded to the transport box and the delivery box, for example, to set a holding temperature to maintain the goods or to deliver GPS coordinates for the delivery location.,\n",
       " 14 The Internet merchant provides to a delivery person or service means for accessing the customer's delivery box, by providing a programmable keycard or other electronic key device, or providing a cipher lock code, or the like. Delivery access code information may be provided via a secure server over the Internet from the Internet merchant, who produces the corresponding keycard at the time of paid order confirmation, to the delivery service. The electronic key device bearing the access code is used upon delivery, and may be left with the delivered goods as a receipt.,\n",
       " 15 On delivery of the goods to the delivery site, a delivery person uses the electronic key device to gain access into the delivery box, placing the goods into the delivery box. A transport box may interact with the delivery box to perform security functions, or to receive power from the delivery box to ensure continuation of environmental parameters or other settings maintained by the transport box. The transport box, equipped with a GPS, may compare the actual location with the expected delivery location to verify that the goods have been properly delivered. A mismatch causes an alarm, such as illuminating an indicator light or generating a service warning. In the case of high value goods, a mismatch may disable a lock on the transport box, preventing access to the goods within. This serves both to enhance security of deliveries of high value goods, and to prevent accidental erroneous deliveries when a delivery person, carrying multiple transport boxes, places the wrong transport box into a delivery box.,\n",
       " 16 On receipt of goods, the delivery box creates a signal to alert the customer that the goods have arrived, and creates and forwards a tracking confirmation to the Internet merchant.,\n",
       " 17 These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.,\n",

       " 32 As shown in FIGS. 1-3, the system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet employs a delivery box 100 having a front door 102 securable by an electronic lock 104 for access to a large interior space 120. In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic lock 104 includes a keycard reader 106, such as a magnetic strip card reader or the like, for reading a keycard 105 to gain entry to the interior space 120. The delivery box 100 may be embodied in a stand-alone configuration, having only the front door 102 for access, or in a wall-mounted pass-through configuration as illustrated, seen mounted through a wall W in FIG. 3, having additionally a second door 110 for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. The delivery box 100, especially in the stand-alone configuration, may be used for mobile applications as well as at a fixed location. The second door 110 may include a lock 112 for security, such as a key lock or an electronic cipher lock so that access to the interior space 120 can controlled through both the front door 102 and the second door 110. The delivery box 100 has a controller circuit 150 in communication with the locks 104 and 112, to manage access codes and access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100.,\n",
       " 33 The interior space 120 of the delivery box 100 is divided into smaller spaces, including one or more transport box receptacles 122 adapted to receive goods packaged in a transport box 200. At least one additional space 126 is provided for receiving goods not packaged in a transport box 200. Each transport box receptacle 122 includes electrical contacts 124 disposed therein to provide electrical power to matching contacts on a transport box 200, the electrical power powering a refrigerating, heating, or other device contained within the transport box 200. Additionally, electrical contacts may provide for a data communication between the controller circuit 150, of the delivery box 100, and a controller circuit 250 contained in the transport box 200. Alternatively, a wireless method of communication may be used for communication between the controller circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 and the controller circuit 250 contained in the transport box 200.,\n",
       " 34 Turning now to FIG. 4, a transport box 200 is shown in greater detail. A transport box 200 is a container having an interior space 202 for receiving goods for transport or shipment. A hinged or removable cover 204 allows access to the interior space 202. The transport box 200 includes environment control means 206 for controlling the environment within the interior space, such as a resistance or other type of heating device, a Peltier thermoelectric device for heating and cooling, a miniaturized Stirling cycle cooler, or other devices for providing heating and or cooling to the interior space 202. Note that, in some embodiments, a passive means for maintaining heat or cold, such as an ice pack, may be used.,\n",
       " 35 In the illustrated embodiment, a control circuit 250 is in communication with the environment control means 206 and operates the environment control means 206 to maintain a predetermined environment within the interior space 202. Electrical contacts 208 on the outside of the transport box 200 are adapted for engagement with the electrical contacts 124 in a transport box receptacle 122 within a delivery box 100. An electronic locking mechanism 210 may be provided in communication with the control circuit 250, whereby the transport box 200 may be locked until unlocked by the control circuit 250, such as when the control circuit recognizes that the transport box 200 has been placed within a transport box receptacle 122 within a delivery box 100.,\n",
       " 36 Turning now to FIG. 5, a block diagram illustrates the relationship between the various electrical components of a delivery box 100, and a transport box 200 placed within transport box receptacle 122 of the delivery box 100. On placement of the transport box 200 into a transport box receptacle 122 within the delivery box 100, a communication interface 158 is established between the delivery box 100 control circuit 150 and the transport box 200 control circuit 250. The control circuit 150 and the control circuit 250 communicate across the electrical contacts 124 in connection with electrical contacts 208. A wireless interface is established between control circuit 150 and control circuit 250 in an alternate embodiment.,\n",
       " 37 The delivery box 100 control circuit 150 is in communication, via a communication interface 152, with the Internet 20. The communication interface 152 may employ a wireless technology for remote communication. The control circuit 150 is also in communication with the card reader 106 and the electronic lock 104, reading a security code from an electronic keycard 105 swiped through, or inserted into, the card reader 106 and activating the electronic lock 104 according to a valid or an invalid security code. Similarly, if the lock 112 on the second door 110 of the delivery box 100 is an electronic lock, the control circuit 150 may be in communication with lock 112, and, optionally, a user interface 154 such as a keypad or electronic key reader or the like for controlling or recording user access to the delivery box.,\n",
       " 38 The control circuit 150 also includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 151. The GPS receiver 151 is used to determine the location of the delivery box 100 for delivery purposes. In a mobile application, or for a fixed location application where the location of the delivery box 100 is not well described by a street address or other means, the GPS coordinates of the location of the delivery box 100 are used instead of an address to identify the location of the delivery box 100 for deliveries.,\n",
       " 39 The control circuit 150 may also operate a heating and/or cooling device 156 disposed within an interior space of the delivery box 100. The control circuit 150 preferably includes a microcomputer or microcontroller, or other type of programmable logic device, and a memory for storing programming instructions.,\n",
       " 40 Weight sensors 500 may be disposed inside the delivery box 100 and communicate with the controller 150. As shown in FIG. 12A, the weight of delivery goods may be measured and then registered via step 1202 at the point of sale (POS) and stored in the controller of the transport box via step 1204. Software in the controller 150 may be programmed to compare the weight of the delivered goods at the point of reception (POR), i.e., at the delivery box 100, with the weight of the delivery goods recorded at the point of sale. As shown in FIG. 12B, the POR processing entails the POS weight of goods being retrieved from the transport box controller at step 1206 and compared with the sensor reading at step 1208. Any weight discrepancy results in notification of the recipient at step 1210 and notification of the merchant at step 1212. If the weight is included in the shipping instructions, the goods delivery may be rejected based on non-compliance with the shipping instructions due to weight discrepancy. Otherwise, a ready-OK indication notifies the user (recipient) at step 1214.,\n",
       " 41 The transport box 200 control circuit 250 of the illustrated embodiment includes a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 252, and a wireless communications interface 254 such as Bluetooth, wireless Ethernet (802.11b) or a similar technology. The control circuit 250 is in communication with the electronic locking mechanism 210, and with the environment control means 206 comprising a heating 258 and/or a cooling device 256. The control circuit 250 preferably includes a microcomputer or microcontroller, or other type of programmable logic device, and a memory for storing programming instructions.,\n",
       " 42 Turning now to FIG. 6, a system for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet is illustrated employing a delivery box 100 in communication with the Internet 20. A customer using a customer computer 12 to access the Internet 20 browses the World Wide Web seeking an Internet merchant of desired goods, and places an order for delivery of goods to the customer's delivery box 100. An Internet merchant server 14 in communication with the Internet 20 receives a customer order for goods, along with delivery instructions for the goods, and dispatches the order for fulfillment to a warehouse 16, such as by way of vendor or warehouse computer 15 in communication with the server 14 via the Internet 20. An identification or security code is generated for the order, and a keycard is created bearing code in an electronically readable format. The goods are packaged into a transport box 200, and electronic delivery instructions downloaded into the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200, along with the keycard. A shipping or transportation company 18 delivers the transport box 200 to the customer's delivery box 100, using the keycard to open the delivery box 100, whereupon the transport box 200 is placed into a transport box receptacle 122 within the delivery box 100 for access by the customer.,\n",
       " 43 Turning now to FIGS. 7-10, a method for delivery of goods ordered via the Internet is described, the method employing a delivery box 100, a transport box 200, and the system briefly described in FIG. 6. The method may be embodied in a computer program executing on an Internet merchant server 14, and in programming of the control circuit 150 in the delivery box and programming of the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200. In such an embodiment, the computer program generally functions as a Web service to provide customer interface functions to a client program such as an Internet browser functioning on a customer computer 12.,\n",
       " 44 A method for entering an order by a customer is described in FIG. 7. A customer begins the process by browsing the Internet 20, and particularly a merchant Web site, to locate goods for purchase (step 702). With goods selected, an order is entered (step 704), identifying a delivery address for the customer, or the location of the delivery box 100 indicated by the GPS 151, and identifying the customer's delivery box 100. The order entry includes completion of a payment transaction, wherein the customer enters payment information such as a credit card number or appropriate identification for another online payment service.,\n",
       " 45 Once the order is entered, and payment confirmed, a unique delivery or access code is generated (step 706), and a keycard 105 is generated containing the delivery or access code. The delivery code will function as a security code for delivery access to the delivery box 100, and also may be used to track the order. Note that separate security and tracking codes may be used. Codes are preferably encrypted for distribution, over the Internet, to the merchant and the delivery box 100. Delivery instructions are then generated (step 708). The delivery instructions may include electronic delivery instructions that are downloadable into the delivery box 100 and into a transport box 200, identifying special handling for the goods that will be supported by the delivery box 100 and transport box 200.,\n",
       " 46 In the above, additional security may be provided by the usage of additional wireless or hardwired sensors. As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a wireless tag, such as a radio frequency ID (RFID) chip 300 may be embedded within keycard 105. Alternatively, such a wireless tag may be carried by the delivery person, RFID chip 300 (or any other wireless transmitter) includes either the same access code or a secondary access code, which is transmitted and received by a wireless sensor 302, mounted on the interior of door 102, or mounted in any other suitable location within the system. In order to access the interior, the delivery person needs to swipe the keycard 105, which has the proper access code encoded thereon, and also have the wireless tag 300. Alternatively, a wired system may be utilized. Sensor 302 is in communication with controller 250.,\n",
       " 47 Additionally, a similar sensor 304 (as shown in FIG. 1) may be mounted on the interior side of the system, requiring the interior, household user to also have an encoded wireless tag. Further, as shown in FIG. 3, a computer port 306, such as a USB port or the like, may be incorporated in the internal door 110, with sensor 304 and USB port 306 also being in communication with controller 250. In order to access the interior, the user needs to have the properly encoded wireless tag, along with a portable device or computer, also having an encrypted code stored thereon, which is transmitted to controller 250 via port 306. It should be understood that any suitable type of sensor may be utilized, and any suitable type of computer interface may also be utilized. The wireless sensors and USB port shown in the Figures are shown for exemplary purposes only.,\n",
       " 48 The electronic delivery instructions include temperature or environmental parameters that will be maintained by the delivery box 100 and transport box 200, and may also include security instructions such as a geographic area or GPS location where delivery is to occur. The delivery instructions may also include a due date or time, or an expiration time for the order. The order, security code, and delivery instructions are forwarded to the merchant or a warehouse facility 16 for fulfillment of the order (step 710), and are forwarded to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 712).,\n",
       " 49 A method for fulfilling an order at a merchant or warehouse facility 16 is described in FIG. 8. The order, security code, and delivery instructions are received by the merchant or warehouse facility (step 802). The order is fulfilled (step 804) by identifying the ordered goods, and preparing them for shipment. With reference to the order and delivery instructions, the merchant or warehouse facility determines if a transport box 200 will be needed for delivery of the goods (step 806). If the goods require a controlled environment or temperature during shipping, or if the delivery instructions require special security for the goods, a transport box 200 is used. The transport box 200 is prepared by downloading the security code and delivery instructions to the transport box 200, the delivery instructions being stored within the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200 (step 808). The goods are packed into the transport box and the transport box is electromechanically locked (step 810). The goods are then delivered to the customer's delivery box 100 (step 812).,\n",
       " 50 During the course of transport for delivery, the transport box 200 maintains a proper temperature for holding the goods. Additionally, the transport box 200 control circuit 250 may monitor the GPS 252 to determine if the transport box 200 has been transported outside of a pre-determined geographic area, indicated in the delivery instructions, such that the transport box 200 may have been stolen, misrouted, or mishandled. An alert may be forwarded by the transport box 200, by wireless connection to the Internet, to the merchant, shipper, or customer.,\n",
       " 51 Turning now to FIGS. 9 and 10, a method for delivering goods to the customer's delivery box 100, and subsequently to the customer, is described. When a delivery person arrives at the customer's delivery box 100, a security code must be entered for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. In the illustrated embodiment, a keycard 105, carrying a security code in a computer readable format, is swiped through the card reader 106, whereupon the control circuit 150 reads the security code (step 902). If the code read is not a valid code (checked at 904), the control circuit 150 does not activate the electronic lock 104 for access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. Instead, a notification may be made to alert the customer that an unauthorized or unexpected attempt to open the delivery box 100 was made (step 918).,\n",
       " 52 If a valid security code is read, an order stored by the control circuit 150 is retrieved (step 906) along with the delivery instructions for the order. The order may be accepted or rejected (at 908) depending on whether or not the delivery of goods complies with the delivery instructions. For example, delivery instructions for an order may have specified a delivery deadline that has been missed. If the order is rejected, a notification is sent to the vendor (or shipper) (step 916), and the customer may be notified (at 918). If the order is accepted, the control circuit 150 commands the electronic lock 104 to open (step 910), allowing access to the interior space 120 of the delivery box 100. On entry to the delivery box 100, the delivery person may find an old transport box 200 left over from a previous delivery, in which case the old transport box 200 is removed for return to the merchant or shipper (step 911). If the delivered goods are packaged in a transport box 200, the transport box 200 is placed into a transport box receptacle 122 (step 912) within the delivery box 100, whereupon the electrical contacts 208 on the transport box 200 are brought into contact with the electrical contacts 124 of the transport box receptacle 122. Goods delivered without a transport box 200 are placed in an additional space 126 within the delivery box 100.,\n",
       " 53 With a transport box 200 placed into a transport box receptacle 122, the control circuit 250 of the transport box 200 communicates with the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100. The order and delivery instructions stored in the transport box 200 are compared against the order and delivery instructions stored in the delivery box 100, to verify that the correct order has been received. If there is a mismatch (decided at step 914), for example when a delivery person has opened the delivery box 100 with the correct keycard 105 but placed a wrong transport box 200 inside by mistake, an alert is issued, and the vendor may be notified (at 916) and the customer may be notified (at 918).,\n",
       " 54 Continuing on FIG. 10, once the order is completed with goods placed into the delivery box 100, the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 may cause an alert to notify the customer of the delivery of the goods (step 1002). In some configurations, the customer will be required to enter a security code to gain access to the goods within the delivery box 100. In a delivery box 100 having only front door 102 for access, for example, the customer will need to enter a code to unlock the door. Similarly, if a second door 110 is configured with an electronic lock such as electronic cipher lock 112, a security code may be required for the customer to gain entry. If a security code is required (at step 1004), the customer enters the code and the control circuit 150 of the delivery box 100 reads the security code. If a valid code is entered, the control circuit 150 allows the customer to open a door for removal of the goods. If the goods are not in a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016) once a door is open for delivery. If the goods are contained within a transport box 200, the order and delivery instructions may be retained until the transport box 200 is removed from its transport box receptacle 122. If the transport box 200 is not timely removed from the transport box receptacle 122 after the delivery box 100 is opened by the customer (determined at 1014), a reminder may be generated to notify the customer (step 1012). Once the transport box is removed, the order and delivery instructions may be deleted or archived (step 1016).,\n",
       " 55 An alternative embodiment of the delivery box 100, shown in FIG. 11, features a PC pluggable interface 3002 which is attached to the inside access door 110 and provides a plug-in connection for a PC unit to allow control/status functions (e.g., lock/unlock, thermal control, status, and the like) to be issued/accessed therefrom, which are acted upon by the controller circuit 150 of the delivery box 100. Thus, the plug-in PC unit may perform the functions of the inside user interface 154. Alternatively to the PC pluggable interface 3002, a slotted tablet attachment bar 3000 is provided on the outside of the inside access door 110, so that a wireless tablet 1102 can be retained via the lengthwise slot in the attachment bar 3000. The controller circuit 150 may be adapted for communication with the wireless tablet 1102, thereby allowing lock/unlock, status commands, and the like, to be issued using the wireless tablet 1102.,\n",
       " 56 It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the following claims.,\n",
       " 1 Systems and methods are provided to prevent unauthorized credit and debit transactions. A system creates a transactional, or one-time-use PIN in response to a request from a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer, belonging to an authorized user. This PIN is securely transmitted to the mobile device, and used in combination with a credit or debit account number to complete the transaction. The user is determined to be authorized by the fact that they are able to access an application on the mobile device that sends the request. The application itself may be protected using a non-changing PIN.,\n",
       " 2 This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/453,911, filed Mar. 17, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.,\n",
       " 3 The present invention relates to preventing identity theft, and more particularly to the use of a mobile device and a one-time PIN to prevent harm arising from credit and debit card skimming.,\n",
       " 4 Skimming is commonly defined as the theft of credit or debit card information used in an otherwise legitimate transaction. For example, thieves may skim card numbers by installing credit card readers and/or false keyboards and cameras in an ATM machine. The theft occurs when an unsuspecting user inserts a credit or debit card into the compromised reader, which copies the information on the card. The user then enters their personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM keypad. The PIN is captured by camera, or for ATMs with out touch screens, by an overlay device installed over or in the ATM keypad. Using a magnetic card writer, a commonly available device, the thieves duplicate the information from the card's magnetic stripe onto a dummy card. They then use the dummy card and stolen PIN in an ATM machine (or other point-of-sale device) to empty the user's bank account or make illegal purchases. Skimmers have targeted many ATMs, even some installed inside bank premises.,\n",
       " 5 Skimming represents an ongoing problem that costs financial institutions fees in the form of charge backs, fraud detection programs, and fraudulent purchase refund guarantees to consumers, among others. While some groups in Europe have installed smartcards into their plastic credit and debit cards to prevent card duplication, this does not prevent a thief who skims a PIN from stealing the physical card (perhaps, by waiting around the corner from the ATM machine). The thief will still be able to drain the user's bank account if he acts quickly, before the user has an opportunity to report that the card has been stolen.,\n",
       " 6 A principle problem with skimming is that the authentication factors used to complete the transaction, namely the account number and PIN, do not change. To solve this problem, various embodiments of the invention create a “transactional” PIN. The transactional PIN is useful only for a single transaction, and may also be useful for only a limited time, such as five minutes. The PIN is created in response to a request made by an application that is downloaded onto a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. Thus, the burden of authentication is transferred from the ATM or other transactional device to the user's mobile device. Authentication is guaranteed because the individual must first authenticate to their mobile device (and to the application thereon). The credit or debit card then becomes merely a physical token that may be combined with the authentication factors used by the individual to log in to their mobile device to provide complete authentication for the transaction.,\n",
       " 7 Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for authenticating a physical token as part of initiation of a commercial credit or debit transaction. The physical token may be a credit card or debit card having a magnetic stripe in which are stored data pertaining to a credit account or a debit account. The transaction is implemented using a transactional device, such as an ATM or point-of-sale device having a magnetic stripe reader.,\n",
       " 8 The method includes a number of processes. First, the method includes receiving, in a computer system from a mobile device, a request to initiate the transaction, the request including data pertinent to the transaction. The computer system may be located remotely, on the premises of a financial institution, or it may be part of the transactional device itself. The mobile device may be a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, or a laptop computer, among other devices. The request data optionally may include data identifying a party seeking to initiate the transaction, a withdrawal amount, a good or service that is the subject of the transaction, or a sales price.,\n",
       " 9 Next, the method calls for generating a transactional PIN in the computer system, encrypting the transactional PIN using an encryption key uniquely associated with the mobile device, and transmitting the encrypted transactional PIN to the mobile device. Finally, the method calls for receiving from the transactional device the unencrypted transactional PIN and data pertaining to the physical token, before a pre-specified expiration time. The pre-specified expiration time may be, for example, no greater than 60 seconds after receiving the request. The short-range wireless network may include, among other things, a near-field communications network or a cellular telephone network. If the computer system is part of the transactional device, it may use the short-range wireless network to transmit the encrypted transactional PIN to the mobile device.,\n",
       " 10 In this way, receiving the unencrypted transactional PIN indicates that the encrypted transactional PIN was decrypted by the mobile device using a decryption key uniquely associated with the mobile device. Further, receiving the unencrypted transactional PIN and the physical token before the pre-specified expiration time indicates that the same individual possesses the unencrypted PIN and the physical token, so as to authenticate the physical token.,\n",
       " 11 ATMs that use embodiments of this invention can prevent the fraudulent transactions associated with skimming. Even if the ATM is compromised via skimming, and a consumer's information is stolen, the thieves cannot get a usable PIN for future use. Any reuse of the PIN with that card (or a dummy card) will cause the ATM to alert the financial institution to the presence of a possible skimmer. Since the PIN is unique, the location of the skimmer can now be determined. Along with a timestamp and video footage, the image of the perpetrator can be recovered, and sent to law enforcement authorities.,\n",
       " 12 Advantageously, the invention may be embodied without any change to existing ATM hardware. Also, ATM transactions work unchanged, and no slow down is experienced by the customer. A software change is required, but only at the financial institution. On the customer's end, a user only has to install a new application on their mobile device (such as a smartphone). Banks already provide small screen-enabled websites and smartphone applications for mobile devices. It is contemplated that this invention may be embodied as another such application. Further, such a system may be used with all types of credit or debit card transactions, not just those at ATMs.,\n",
       " 13 A computer program product and a mobile device for use with this method are also contemplated.,\n",
       " 14 The foregoing features will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:,\n",
       " 15 FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing logical processes for registering a mobile device with a financial institution to prepare for use in a transaction in accordance of an embodiment of the present invention;,\n",
       " 16 FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction; and,\n",
       " 17 FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for using a PIN in a particular transaction.,\n",
       " 18 Definitions. As used in this description and the accompanying claims, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated, unless the context otherwise requires:,\n",
       " 19 A “mobile device” is any device, such as a smartphone, personal digital assistant, personal computer, laptop, tablet computer or other device that may perform cryptographic operations and communicate on a short-range wireless data network, such as wireless telephone or near-field communications (NFC) network.,\n",
       " 20 FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing logical processes for registering a mobile device with a financial institution to prepare for use in a transaction in accordance of an embodiment of the present invention. In process 110, a user requests a transactional software application from her financial institution, for use on her mobile device. The concept of such applications generally is well known in the art, but this particular application is new in that it allows the user to receive and process a transactional PIN. In process 120, the financial institution verifies that the user is authorized to download the application. If the user is not authorized, then the method ends in process 130, which may include notifying an authorized user of an attempted, unauthorized transaction. If the user is authorized, then the method continues in process 140, in which the financial institution sends the software application to the user's mobile device as indicated. In process 150, the financial institution updates a database to indicate that the user has downloaded the application and is allowed to access and use the application for commercial transactions.,\n",
       " 21 FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for obtaining a PIN for use in a particular transaction. For example, our user may wish to withdraw money from an ATM, or engage in a purchase at a retail establishment. If so, she would begin in process 210 by unlocking her mobile device and activating the application. Techniques for unlocking mobile devices are known in the art, and generally require entry of a password, biometric data such as a fingerprint, or other information unique to the owner or user. Activating the application may include selecting an icon on a menu screen, for example, or entering a secondary password. The secondary password may be a fixed PIN assigned by the financial institution. In process 220, our user may enter into her mobile device a withdrawal or sales amount and any other data required by the transaction. In one embodiment, the mobile device uses location awareness (for example, the location of the device as determined by a GPS device) to transmit its current location or the location of the nearest ATM. In process 230, her mobile device sends a request containing these data to her financial institution for approval. Transmission of the request may be done using a data communications network known in the art, such as a cellular telephone data network. In process 240, a computer system of the financial institution processes the request to determine whether to approve the request. To make this determination, the financial institution may use the user's available balance, whether her credit card has expired, whether a fraud hold has been placed on her account, and any other information according to techniques known in the art.,\n",
       " 22 In process 250, the computer system makes a determination whether the request is approved. If not, it sends a rejection to the user's mobile device in process 260 using the data communications network. In a typical embodiment, a reason will be sent as well, and this rejection will manifest as an error screen in the transactional software application. In addition, if the request included location data, the financial institution may inform any nearby or indicated transactional device of the rejection in process 262, thereby preventing the user from transacting using these devices.,\n",
       " 23 If the request is approved, in process 270 the financial institution updates its database with a transactional PIN. This PIN may be used only for a single transaction, or series of related transactions, and may not be reused. It is therefore generated, as part of process 270, as a random or pseudo-random number using techniques known in the art. It may also be given an expiration time, so that it may not be used after that time. This time is pre-specified; that is, it is specified in advance of the actual transaction.,\n",
       " 24 Once the transactional PIN has been stored in the database, in process 272 the computer system sends the PIN to the mobile device. This may be done using SMS or other texting system, as known in the art. Finally, the user receives the PIN on her mobile device in process 274. The transactional software application decrypts this PIN, if necessary, and stores it for later use. The actual transaction may not occur for some time, but it must commence before the expiration of the pre-specified expiration time. This delay between preparation and execution is useful, for example, if a user wishes to obtain her PIN while standing in line at an ATM or in a check-out line at a retailer. In such situations, the pre-specified expiration time may be very soon, for example five minutes in the future. This short expiration time advantageously prevents PIN collisions, as well as preventing multiple uses of the same PIN at later times.,\n",
       " 25 In some embodiments, the PIN is encrypted using an encryption key that is uniquely associated with the mobile device before it is transmitted to the mobile device in process 272. For example, the transactional software application may have established an asymmetric encryption/decryption key pair, storing the decryption key locally (and securely, for example in a hardware smartcard) on the mobile device and transmitting the encryption key to the financial institution. In such a situation, the indicated encryption is performed using the transmitted encryption key, which may be stored in the financial institution's database. Or the application itself may have been generated by the financial institution with a decryption key as part of its program code, with the financial institution storing a corresponding encryption key. In the latter case, no cryptographic keys need be transmitted over a network at all.,\n",
       " 26 FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing logical processes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention for using a PIN in a particular transaction. In process 310, the user approaches the transactional device, and inserts her physical token. For example, this may include her inserting a debit card (physical token) into an ATM machine (transactional device). In process 320, the user enters her transactional PIN code upon request from the transactional device. In some embodiments, the user keys in the received PIN. However, in other embodiments, the PIN request itself may be made to the mobile device using a short-range wireless network, such as a near-field communications network or a wireless cellular telephone network. Thus, in some embodiments, the transactional device includes a NFC transceiver or a low-cost picocell wireless transceiver. Entry of the transactional PIN in this embodiment need not be by touch pad; the local wireless network is sufficient. Thus, entry of the PIN may be accomplished by holding the mobile device up to the transactional device. In some embodiments, the mobile device will be already in range of the transceiver, and may transmit the PIN directly and automatically, without mechanical entry at all.,\n",
       " 27 In process 330, the transactional device sends the received PIN and token data to the financial institution for approval of the transaction. In process 340, the financial institution determines if the transaction may proceed. This determination includes matching the transactional PIN to the token data (e.g., credit card number) of the user. Typically, it will do so by consulting the database, in which are stored the transactional PIN, the expiration time, and the user's account information. The financial institution may use other information, such as her current balance, to make this determination.,\n",
       " 28 In process 350, the computer system determines whether the transaction is allowed to proceed. If not, in process 360 a rejection is sent to the transactional device. The transactional device then notifies the user of the rejection in process 362. For example, an ATM may show the user a “not enough cash” screen. If the rejection is caused by a mismatch between the PIN and the physical token, then the financial institution may infer that fraud is taking place. In such situations, the user may be given a false reason for rejection to avoid arousing suspicion. Simultaneously, the date, time, and location of the failed transaction may be stored by the financial institution for later use. In an ATM embodiment, this data may be correlated to security footage taken from a built-in camera at that location to obtain a picture of the person entering the bad PIN. In some cases, an image of the user can be compared against a known image of the account holder, and if the two do not match, the financial institution may give law enforcement the captured image.,\n",
       " 29 If the transaction is permitted, in process 370 an approval message is sent to the transactional device and the physical token is thereby finally authenticated. Thus, the user has been authenticated, and is now authorized to perform transactions using the transactional device. In process 372, the transactional device performs one or more transactions with the user. In process 374, the transactional device sends the results of these transactions to the financial institution for recordation and post-transaction processing as is known in the art. Finally, in process 376, the financial institution invalidates the transactional PIN, preventing it from being further used. In some embodiments, this last process is performed even if the pre-specified time has not yet passed, forcing the user to activate her transactional software application yet again to obtain a new transactional PIN. This extra process is taken because the user has concluded the transaction for which the first PIN was assigned—even if she has made a mistake and needs to correct it by re-authenticating, the system may consider this a new transaction for which a new transactional PIN is required.,\n",

       " 1 A method of identifying a traced media playback decoder embedded in a device, wherein data representative of a trace message is included in the content field of a media content file and a trigger string (16) is included in the user data field of the file. The file is input to the decoder, and a traced decoder is arranged and configured to render the trace message in a desired format in response to detection of the trigger string. If the decoder is not the traced decoder, the trigger string will be disregarded and the component will try and process the media content file like a normal media content file, which results in an error.,\n",
       " 2 This invention relates generally to media playback decoder tracing, for use in tracing the presence of a proprietary media playback decoder, such as in the form of a software component embedded in a device.,\n",
       " 3 There are many circumstances in which it may be required for a software provider to determine whether or not a device, e.g. a mobile telephone, includes a proprietary software component. For this purpose, various methods of software tracing have been developed and implemented. In general, software tracing involves subjecting a device thought to contain traced software to a specified operation, hereinafter referred to as a trace trigger, such that a trace message (i.e. any unambiguous characterization of the presence of the traced software) will only be correctly issued if the traced software is present.,\n",
       " 4 As a specific example, consider the case where the traced software component is a video decoder. For software tracing purposes, the traced software component may include a mechanism, whereby when a specific video stream is input for playback, a trace message is correctly displayed on a device only if the video decoder therein comprises the traced software. Otherwise, a different result, irrespective of what that is, will indicate that the video decoder does not comprise the traced software.,\n",
       " 5 In another example, US Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0233547 describes a mechanism whereby when a software program is legally downloaded (under license) from a server and installed on a user's machine, the authorized user's machine is allocated a unique identification number and this identification number is embedded one or more times within the copy of the software program downloaded thereto. A Client Program is provided which, whenever the software program is to be executed, compares the identification number of the machine on which it is being run with the identification number embedded in the software program and will only permit execution of the software program if the two numbers match. Thus, if a further copy of the software program is illegally provided to another user's machine, it will not run thereon because the identification number embedded in the software program will not match the identification number assigned to the user's machine. Furthermore, the original user can be traced through the identification number embedded in the software program.,\n",
       " 6 More generally, it is known to incorporate a trace message generator in the software component, wherein a trigger string is inserted into a compressed media content file and, when the media content file is played back by the software component, if the software component is not the traced software component, the trigger will be disregarded and the media content will be played back, whereas if the software component is the traced software component, the media decoder will recognize the trigger and cause a message generator to generate a specified trace message. However, the trace message file may be quite large, as will be the overhead due to the additional message generator, thereby increasing the overall overhead of the software component, which is not desirable.,\n",
       " 7 Mechanisms of the above type are often referred to within the software industry as a “back door” and various back door mechanisms are known and commonly used to prevent unauthorized use of proprietary software.,\n",
       " 8 Most media data formats are comprised of (at least) a user data field and a content field, wherein it is possible for data to be “hidden” in the user data field because conformant decoders/parsers are mandated to ignore data in this field. Thus, the user data field might, under some circumstances, be considered to be an appropriate part of a media data file in which to include a trace trigger. However, some specific difficulties are envisaged in implementing software tracing in this manner in media processing components such as video and audio decoders. One of the main difficulties is that such components do not have “direct” access to the device screen so as to enable a textual trace message to be displayed. Media processing components can only output the media format they are designed to produce, for example, a video decoder can only produce images (YUV frames), a music player can only output sound (PCM frames), etc. Thus, although a “trigger” could be provided in the user data field, it is not a simple matter to implement a sufficiently selective and specific trace message output.,\n",
       " 9 It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of identifying a traced media playback decoder, wherein an unambiguous trace message is consistently output in the correct format only if the decoder comprises the traced decoder, with a relatively low probability of accidental triggering, and without affecting the normal behavior or size of the decoder.,\n",
       " 10 In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a decoder for decoding received media content, for playback in a predetermined media format, said media content having a data format comprising a user data field and a content field, wherein data representative of a trace message is included in said content field of the media content, said decoder further comprising means for rendering in said predetermined media format said trace message represented by said data included in said received media content. Also in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for identifying a traced media playback decoder, the decoder being arranged for decoding received media content for playback in a predetermined media format, the method comprising including in said traced decoder means for rendering in said predetermined media format a trace message from representative data included in received media content, inputting a media content file into a media playback decoder, said media content having a data format comprising a user data field and a content field and including in said data field data representative of a trace message, wherein said media playback decoder is identified as a traced media playback decoder only if said trace message is correctly rendered in said predetermined media format during playback of said media content file.,\n",
       " 11 The present invention extends to a media content file for use in a method as defined above, said media content file having a data format comprising a user data field and a content field, wherein data representative of a trace message is included in said content field.,\n",
       " 12 Thus, the above-mentioned object of the invention is achieved by including data representative of a trace message (which unambiguously characterizes the traced media playback decoder) in the content field of an input media content file so that, when the media content file is played back in the appropriate media format, the trace message will be output in the same media format if the playback decoder is, in fact, the traced media playback decoder.,\n",
       " 13 In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the data representative of said trace message comprises a representation in said predetermined media format of the trace message, preferably partially or fully encrypted by a predetermined encryption mechanism, wherein in which case the decoder comprises means for decrypting and rendering in said predetermined media format said encrypted trace message included in said received media content. Said trace message may be encrypted using a product key unique to said traced decoder.,\n",
       " 14 In another exemplary embodiment, the data representative of said trace message comprises a font file included in the content field of said media content, wherein said traced decoder includes a character generator for generating said trace message using said font file.,\n",
       " 15 Beneficially, a trigger signal is included in the user data field of said content file, for causing said traced decoder to render in said predetermined media format said trace message from said representative data included in said received media content. The trigger signal may comprise a trigger string inserted in the user data field of the media content file.,\n",
       " 16 The media content file may be compressed, either before or after encryption of said data representative of said trace message.,\n",
       " 17 The decoder can take the form of a software component comprising software code which is executed by a processing device. It will be appreciated that the decoder can incorporate code to implement other playback functions, in addition to decoding. The software may be tangibly embodied on an electronic memory device, hard disk, optical disk or other machine-readable storage medium. The software may be delivered as a computer program product on a machine-readable carrier or it may be downloaded to a device via a network connection.,\n",
       " 18 These and other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from, and elucidated with reference to, the embodiments described herein.,\n",
       " 19 Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of examples only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:,\n",
       " 20 FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram illustrating a method according to a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention;,\n",
       " 21 FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram illustrating a method according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and,\n",
       " 22 FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating a method according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention.,\n",
       " 23 Thus, as explained above, the present invention is concerned with the provision of an encrypted trace message in the content field of a media content file, which is decrypted and rendered as a highly specific trace message output, in the required media format, during playback of the media content file only if the media playback software component is the respective traced software component.,\n",
       " 24 Many different types of media playback applications are known, and the present invention is not necessarily intended to be limited in this regard. Obviously, the media format of the output trace message is dependent on the media format supported by the media playback software component to be traced.,\n",
       " 25 Consider, for example, a video decoder/player. The typical output should be a YUV signal containing the trace message. It will be appreciated, however, that this signal does not need to be a true “video” signal, in the sense that it may comprise a single still image containing the trace message, wherein the still image is held on the display for some period of time. Alternatively, the trace message may be included in a scrolling display. In the case of an audio player, the typical output should be a PCM array containing the trace message.,\n",
       " 26 Since the trace message is included in the media content, and not in the software component, the disadvantages caused by additional overhead and required use of the resources supporting the software component are avoided.,\n",
       " 27 In the first instance, a trace message is generated in the desired format. Thus, in the case of a video decoder/player, a textual trace message in the form of a bitmap image can be generated by, for example, a character generator, whereas in the case of an audio player, the trace message may comprise a recorded verbal message. In both cases, the content of the trace message is likely to consist of the version number, product and proprietary company, but the present invention is not necessarily intended to be limited in this regard.,\n",
       " 28 The type of encryption used to encrypt the trace message can be relatively primitive, since the single purpose thereof is to cause products that do not contain the traced software to be incapable of processing the media file. For example, XORING the trace message with an arbitrary bit stream (e.g. a symmetric key) which can be quite short, i.e. of a length most efficiently processed by the platform. The key could be uniquely mapped to the product and version number of the traced software component, to avoid false detection of a traced software component in a product.,\n",
       " 29 Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, in a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the trace message file 10 (in the form of a PCM array or YUV signal) is input into a conventional media encoder 12 to generate a compressed trace message 14. Then, a trigger string 16 is inserted and the compressed message and trigger string are partially encrypted using a specified product key 18, to generate a partially encrypted, compressed trace message with trigger 20, which is not a valid standard media content file. It will be appreciated that the trace message and trigger file can only be partially encrypted, in particular encryption must not cover the media file headers since they contain the trace trigger (for example, in the user data field) that the traced software component will need to read before the rest of the tracing process, i.e. decryption and rendering, will be triggered.,\n",
       " 30 It will also be appreciated that the partially encrypted compressed trace message with trigger is not a valid standard media content file because the compressed content is encrypted. Thus, when the partially encrypted compressed trace message with trigger 20 is input to a standard media decoder 22 of a device 24 that does not include the traced software component, an error will occur and the device may even crash. On the other hand, if the partially encrypted compressed trace message with trigger 20 is input to a device 26 including the traced software component, a trigger detector and descrambler 28 regenerates the compressed trace message 14 using the product key 18 and the trigger string 16 as inputs. The compressed trace message 14 is input to a standard media decoder 22 and the original trace message is output in the supported media format.,\n",
       " 31 In order to prevent a conformant media decoder from crashing in response to receiving encrypted compressed content, selective encryption is preferably used to scramble only parts of the bitstream that do not contain control bits, i.e. those parts which do not change the way in which the decoder processes the data but only the final parts of the decompression. However, the embodiment described with reference to FIG. 1, whilst effective, may be unnecessarily complex.,\n",
       " 32 As in the above exemplary embodiment, in conventional systems, media encryption is usually performed after compression because, if raw media is encrypted (or scrambled) the statistical properties of the raw media (on which the compression technologies rely) would be completely changed and the compression performances may thus be severely degraded. However, in the case of the present invention, only the specific trigger file will suffer from this problem and, because the trigger file is included in the media content file, rather than the software component, the size of this file is immaterial.,\n",
       " 33 Thus, referring to FIG. 2 of the drawings, in a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the trace message 10 in the required media format is input to a content scrambler 30 which uses a product key 18, specific to the traced software component, to generate a scrambled trace message 32. The scrambled trace message 32 is input to a standard media encoder 12 and the resultant compressed scrambled trace message 34 is fed to a trigger insertion tool 36 which causes a trigger string 16 to be inserted, to generate a compressed trace message with trigger file 38, which is a standard valid file. This file 38 is incorporated in the content field of a media content file to be input into the standard media decoder 22 of a target device. If the tested device 24 does not contain the traced software component, the media content may be correctly played back, or not, but the trace message 42 will be scrambled. On the other hand, if the tested device 26 does contain the traced software component, the scrambled trace message 32 is regenerated by the standard media decoder 22 using the trigger string 16, and a content descrambler 40 is caused to descramble the scrambled trace message 32 using the product key 18, in response to the detected trigger 33, so as to output the trace message 10.,\n",
       " 34 It will be seen from the above, that the embodiment wherein encryption is performed before compression (FIG. 2), rather than afterwards (FIG. 1), results in a more simplified implementation.,\n",
       " 35 In the above, it is envisaged that the entire frame or array containing the trace message is encrypted. However, it is possible to perform a partial encryption in respect of only the part of the media content (e.g. in the case of video content, only a portion of the screen) containing essential information (e.g. the version number).,\n",
       " 36 One principal consideration in respect of the present invention is that, ideally, there should be a specific media content file designed to test each version of a software component. Thus, if one does not know which version of a software component could be inside a device to be tested, it may be necessary to perform several tests using several different media content files, on a trial-and-error basis, in order to find a possible match.,\n",
       " 37 In order to solve this problem, instead of incorporating the trace message itself in the content field of the incoming media content file, a font file included instead. A font file does not contain the letters or sounds of the trace message themselves, but a collection of instructions that the traced software component can interpret to actually generate the trace message. Thus, a “font” can be defined herein as a collection of patterns (graphical in the case of video and sound in the case of audio) where each pattern corresponds to a text fragment (i.e. a character, word or sentence).,\n",
       " 38 The input media format off the trace trigger file will comprise, as before, a user data field containing the trigger signal which will cause a traced software component to commence the tracing process, but will be ignored by other software components, which will try and process the content file as a normal media content file. As before, the media format may be fully or partially encrypted, which is useful if it is desirable that a product not containing the traced software will not be able to process the incoming media content file at all. The trace trigger media content file contains the trace message minimal font, which forms the basis for generation of the correct trace message according to the version number of the traced software.,\n",
       " 39 Referring to FIG. 3 of the drawings, in an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a font file 50 in the required media content format is input into a media encoder 52 to generate a compressed font message 54. The compressed font message 54 is input to a trigger insertion and message encryption tool 56, which uses a trigger string 16 and product key 18 (specific to the traced software component) as inputs to generate a compressed font message with trigger 58. This is not a valid standard content file. Thus, if it is input to the standard media decoder of a device 24 not having the traced software component, an error will occur. On the other hand, if the file 58 is input to a device 24 incorporating the traced software component, a trigger detector 60 detects the trigger string in the user data field and uses the trigger string 16 and product key 18 as inputs to regenerate the compressed font message 62. The compressed font message 62 and data representative of the version number 64 of the traced software are then used as inputs to a character generator 66 (or “trace message generator”) for generating a trace message in the desired file format.,\n",
       " 40 In the case of video, the font file may consist of YUV rectangular areas, each containing the image of a piece of text (letter, word or sentence fragment). These rectangular areas are ordered in a predefined manner so that the tracing software embedded in the traced software component can easily retrieve them and map each to the corresponding piece of text, which is especially useful for characters (this is the purpose of the font: how to map symbolic character “x” with a way to render in the media the letter “X”). Then, the tracing software will use this font to generate the trace message.,\n",
       " 41 One possible way of implementing this is that this scheme is used only to encode the version number. For example: the input content contains 12 font elements as follows (this is just an example):,\n",
       " 42 i) one font component is an image that displays “this is version”\n",
       " \n",
       " ii) one font component is an image that displays “of company X video decoder”\n",
       " \n",
       " iii) the ten remaining font components are for digits from 0 to 9.\n",
       " \n",
       " The Trace Message is then assembled by using i), then a combination of the elements of iii) corresponding to the version number of the tested software, then using ii).,\n",
       " 43 In case of audio, the font consists of pieces of sentences (but nothing smaller than syllables: this is because the “sound” of letters is not useful to make sentences, a classical text-to-speech problem, each font item contains the PCM samples of such a sentence fragment. These PCM arrays are placed in the media container in a predefined manner so that the Tracing Software embedded in the Traced Software can easily retrieve them and map each to a given character sequence. Then, the Tracing Software will use this font to generate the Trace Message.,\n",
       " 44 Typically one possible scheme is to encode in a single fragment whole pieces of the message that do not change such as “this is version”. On the contrary, the Version Number can be constructed by using encodings of each number “One”, “Two”, “Three”, etc.,\n",
       " 45 The key advantage of this method is that the memory footprint of the Tracing Software can be drastically reduced since it does not contain the media material required for output, but instead it “finds” it inside the input media file that also contains the Trace Trigger.,\n",
       " 46 It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be capable of designing many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed in parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claims.

The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.,\n",
       " 1 Systems, devices, and methods for secure transaction processing are provided. A point-of-transaction device may receive a selection of transaction parameters to establish and store a security rule. The point-of-transaction device may then receive a transaction request and confirm that the transaction request complies with the security rule. The point-of-transaction device may forward the security rule and the transaction request to a transaction security server that stores the security rule and further verifies that the transaction request complies with the security rule. The transaction security server may also forward at least a portion of the transaction request to a third party that further confirms an identity of the customer.,\n",
       " 2 The present invention relates to secured point-of-sale transaction systems and methods that permit a user to create security rules locally that can be applied to transactions.,\n",
       " 3 Transactions are an integral component of virtually every economy. Exemplary transactions may include, but are not limited to, purchases, money transfers, deposits, prepaid cards, mobile connections, etc. For each transaction, the user (e.g., agent, retailer, bank, service provider, etc.) can be faced with competing interests. On one hand, there is a need for the user to provide a satisfactory experience for the customer. On the other hand, financial considerations and legal requirements favor the prevention of fraud, identity theft, money laundering, and the like, when conducting transactions.,\n",
       " 4 For some cash-based transactions, standard security procedures do not require proof of identity of the customer and/or the customer's identity is not obtained, verified, or otherwise associated with the transaction. For other transaction types (e.g., credit/debit card and/or cash-based transactions) where identification of the customer may be obtained, the customer's identity is not always confirmed and/or associated with the transaction. For example, the user may request some form of identification from the customer during a transaction. Typically, the user uses the proffered identification to confirm that the proof of identification corresponds to the customer, e.g., has the same name as appears on a credit card being used by the customer. However, the user typically cannot confirm that the proof of identification provided by the customer is authentic.,\n",
       " 5 Furthermore, the user is typically limited to security rules established by, for example, credit card issuing companies. As is understood, a credit card issuing company typically establishes a rule that no identification is required for card-based transactions below a de minimis dollar amount. Beyond that dollar amount, the company requires a signature or a personal identification number (PIN) to serve as the customer's identification component. The user can request some form of identification to confirm that the signatures/name matches. However, such credit card issuing company rules do not help the user prevent fraud when the transaction is cash-based and, further, do not permit the user to establish its own security rules that can be applied to transactions of varying amounts or types.,\n",
       " 6 Thus, there is a need to permit the user to establish security rules that can be applied to transactions and, in some instances, to confirm the identification of the customer to the transaction.,\n",
       " 7 In one set of illustrative embodiments, a method of conducting transactions may include receiving, at a point of transaction device, a selection of a transaction type, a selection of a triggering transaction amount, and a selection of at least one transaction parameter; storing a security rule associating the at least one transaction parameter with the selected transaction type and the selected triggering transaction amount; receiving a transaction request matching the transaction type and satisfying the triggering transaction amount; and selectively forwarding at least a portion of the transaction request to a transaction security system based on a determination of whether the transaction request complies with the security rule.,\n",
       " 8 According to a second set of illustrative embodiments, a method of conducting a transaction may include receiving a transaction security configuration, the transaction security configuration based at least in part on one or more predefined transaction parameters; receiving a transaction request comprising information identifying at least one transaction parameter; comparing the transaction request to the transaction security configuration; and forwarding at least a portion of the transaction request to a third party based on the comparison of the transaction request to the transaction security configuration.,\n",
       " 9 According to a third set of illustrative embodiments, an apparatus for conducting transactions may include a processor; memory in electronic communication with the processor; and instructions being executable by the processor to, receive, at a point of transaction device, a selection of a transaction type, a selection of a triggering transaction amount, and a selection of at least one transaction parameter; store a security rule associating the at least one transaction parameter with the selected transaction type and the selected triggering transaction amount; receive a transaction request matching the transaction type and satisfying the triggering transaction amount; and selectively forward at least a portion of the transaction request to a transaction security system based on a determination of whether the transaction request complies with the security rule.,\n",

       " 24 Methods, systems, and devices are disclosed for a user to establish a security rule, or a security configuration including a plurality of security rules, that are applied during transactions to provide a secured point-of-sale transaction. The systems may include a point-of-transaction device in operative communication with a transaction security server. According to certain embodiments, the point-of-transaction device receives a selection of certain transaction parameters and, based on the selected transaction parameters, establishes and stores a security rule. In one example, the transaction parameters may include a selection of a transaction type, a selection of a triggering transaction amount, and a selection of at least one additional transaction parameter. The at least one transaction parameter may comprise a selection of a predetermined security level response associated with the transaction, e.g., what steps the user must follow for a given transaction type/amount to ensure security. Exemplary security rules include, but are not limited to, a requirement for a customer's signature for a cash-based transaction up to a first transaction amount, a requirement to capture an image of the customer for a card-based transaction up to a second transaction amount, a requirement to capture an additional biometric parameter from the customer for a cash or card-based transaction up to a third transaction amount, and the like. The point-of-transaction device may store the security rules and then apply the security rules to each transaction, i.e., may require certain security steps based on the transaction.,\n",
       " 25 The point-of-transaction device may communicate the security rule, and/or a security configuration including multiple security rules, to the transaction security server where the server stores the security rule/configuration. The point-of-transaction device may then receive a transaction request that matches the transaction type and satisfies the triggering transaction amount, i.e., is of the same transaction type and for at least the minimum triggering amount for that transaction. The point-of-transaction device may apply the security rule locally or forward at least a portion of the transaction request to the transaction security system based on the transaction request complying with the matched security rule. The transaction security system may determine or confirm that the transaction request complies with the matched security rule and, if so, forward at least a portion of the transaction request to a third party.,\n",
       " 26 This description provides examples, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention. Rather, the ensuing description will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing embodiments of the invention. Various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements.,\n",
       " 27 Thus, various embodiments may omit, substitute, or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance, it should be appreciated that the methods may be performed in an order different than that described, and that various steps may be added, omitted or combined. Also, aspects and elements described with respect to certain embodiments may be combined in various other embodiments. It should also be appreciated that the following systems, methods, devices, and software may individually or collectively be components of a larger system, wherein other procedures may take precedence over or otherwise modify their application.,\n",
       " 28 As used herein, the terms “user(s)” and “customer(s)” generally refer to the parties to a transaction. By way of example only, a user may be an individual, an agent, a bank teller, a service provider, a brick-and-mortar business, etc. In some situations, the user may be the party to the transaction that provides certain goods and/or services being exchanged during the transaction. The customer may be an individual, representative of a company, a group of individuals, etc. In some situations, the customer is the party to the transaction that seeks to receive the goods and/or services being provided by the user. According to one example, the user may be an agent at a money transfer business where the customer is an individual seeking to transfer money. According to another example, the user may be an agent of a government agency charged with distributing government subsidies where the customer is an individual seeking to receive the subsidies. According to a third example, the user is an agent or clerk at a retail store and the customer is an individual consumer.,\n",
       " 29 As used herein, the term “transaction” refers to any exchange between a user and a customer. The transaction may be monetary or non-monetary based. The transaction may be for money, for products, for services, for information, etc. According to some examples, the transaction may be a one-way transaction, e.g., a money transfer exchange where the customer provides money to an agent to be transferred to a different location. In that instance, a second user and customer may complete another transaction at the remote location. Furthermore, a transaction is not limited to a single user and/or a single customer.,\n",
       " 30 Systems, devices, methods, and software are described for secure transaction processing in a system of networked devices.,\n",
       " 31 FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 configured for conducting secured point-of-sale transactions according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The system 100 includes a point-of-transaction device(s) 105, a transaction security server 110, and a third party 115. Each of these components may be in communication, directly or indirectly, via one or more of a wired and/or a wireless communications channel.,\n",
       " 32 In the example of FIG. 1, the point-of-transaction device 105 is located proximate a customer 120 and/or a user 125. For example, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be located in a business establishment operated by the user 125. Generally, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to permit the user 125 to input, capture, transmit, and/or receive selections related to the establishment of security rules as well as additional parameters related to the transaction. For instance, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to permit the user to input, capture, or otherwise receive selections of a transaction type, a selection of a triggering transaction amount, and/or a selection of at least one transaction parameter. The point-of-transaction device may also be configured to store a security rule that associates the at least one transaction parameter with the selected transaction type and the selected triggering transaction amount.,\n",
       " 33 The transaction type may include information or data indicative of whether the transaction is a cash-based transaction, a card-based transaction (e.g., where the customer is paying using a credit or debit card), an exchange of goods or services transaction, or another transaction type. The triggering transaction amount may include information or data indicative of the monetary amount involved in the transaction (e.g., the dollar amount) or some other information indicative of the item/service being exchanged during the transaction. A transaction does not necessarily involve the exchange of monetary funds. According to one example, the transaction may be for the distribution of items to individuals. In that example, the transaction amount may refer to the quantity of items being distributed to the customer 120. Accordingly, the triggering transaction amount may include information or data indicative of the amount or worth of the items/services being exchanged in the transaction. The at least one transaction parameter may include information or data indicative of an action or response that is to be initiated for a given transaction type and/or triggering transaction amount. For example, the at least one transaction parameter may include information requiring capture of a signature of the customer, capturing an image of the customer, capturing biometric data from the customer, capturing an image of an identification card from the customer, and the like.,\n",
       " 34 Accordingly, the user 125 can utilize the point-of-transaction device 105 to establish a wide variety of security rules to be applied to differing transactions. As one example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where an image of the customer is captured for every cash-based transaction, regardless of the transaction amount. As another example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish security rules where the at least one transaction parameter captured from the customer becomes progressively more restrictive as the triggering transaction amount increases. As an even further example, the user can select applicable transaction parameters to establish a security rule where biometric data is captured from the customer during the transaction, communicated to the transaction security server for verification, and a confirmation signal is received from the transaction security server before approving the transaction. Other security rules can be selected and established based on the needs of the user 125, legal requirements, developing business practices, and the like. As can be appreciated, the user 125 can establish a wide variety of differing security rules that vary based on the selection of, for example, the type of transaction, the value involved in the transaction, developing industry standards, and the like. As can be further appreciated, the user 125 can dynamically edit, delete, or establish security rules dependent on varying business or social conditions. Thus, the user 125 is provided a great deal of flexibility to establish security rules that favor the prevention of fraud, theft, and the like.,\n",
       " 35 The point-of-transaction device 105 may also be configured to permit the user 125 to input or capture an identification parameter from the customer. The identification parameter may be included as a part of the transaction request and be collected from the customer 120 as a part of the transaction. The identification parameter may identify the customer that is a party to the transaction. As indicated by the dashed line, certain embodiments permit the customer 120 to input some of the parameters associated with the transaction into the point-of-transaction device 105. The identification parameter may be any information captured from the customer 120 during the transaction. For example, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to capture an image, a voice print, a fingerprint, or any other form of biometric data from the customer 120 contemporaneous to the transaction. Also, or alternatively, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to capture an image of an identification card provided by the customer 120 as proof of identity, e.g., an image of the customer 120's drivers license, government issued identification card, etc.,\n",
       " 36 Once the user 125 has established the security rules, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to, as the user 125 and/or customer 120 enters parameters associated with the transaction, determine which of the security rule(s) established by the user 125 applies to that transaction and prompt the user 125 and/or customer 120 for the appropriate compliance measures. As one example, if a security rule input by the user 125 requires an image of the customer for cash-based transactions over $100.00, once the point-of-transaction device 105 determines that the transaction is a cash-based transaction for an amount in excess of the triggering transaction amount, the point-of-transaction device 105 may prompt the user 125 and/or customer 120 to capture an image of the customer 120 before proceeding with the transaction. Once the image of the customer 120 has been captured, the point-of-transaction device 105 may be configured to permit the user 125 to finalize the transaction.,\n",
       " 37 Furthermore, the point-of-transaction device 105 is communicatively coupled to the transaction security server 110 via one or more of a wired and/or a wireless communication channel. For instance, the point-of-transaction device 105 may communicate the security rule to the transaction security server 110 and also communicate the request for the transaction to the transaction security server 110 via at least one of the communications channels.,\n",
       " 38 The transaction security server 110 may include a transaction request module 135, a reporting module 140, a transaction security configuration records 145, transaction parameters records 150, and authentication rule records 155. Each of these components may be communicatively coupled via, for example, a common bus or other communications channel. The transaction security server 110 may be communicatively coupled with a number of point-of-transaction devices 105 (only one being shown in FIG. 1 for clarity) and the third party 115. Broadly, the transaction security server 110 may be configured to receive the security rules and the transaction request from the point-of-transaction device 105, store the security rule in the security configuration records 145, authenticate or otherwise confirm the identity of the customer based on the identification parameter, determine whether the transaction request complies with the applicable security rule, and return confirmation signal to the point-of-transaction device 105. The transaction security server 110 may be implemented by a single server device or by a number of related components interconnected over a network.,\n",
       " 39 The transaction security configuration records 145 may be electronic records stored in memory and including information related to one or more security rules for each of the point-of-transaction devices 105. As one example, the transaction security configuration records 145 may include information relating to different security rules for each point-of-transaction device 105 and/or a set of security rules that are applicable to a plurality of point-of-transaction devices 105. Thus, the transaction security configuration records 145 may store the security rules established by the user 125 at the point-of-transaction device 105.,\n",
       " 40 The transaction parameter records 150 may be electronic records stored in memory and including information related to a plurality of transaction parameters. These transaction parameters may include data identifying the customer 120 associated with a transaction request. Examples of transaction parameters include, but are not limited to, one or more images of the customer, other biometric information related to the customer 120 (e.g., facial recognition data, fingerprint data, retinal scan data, etc.), images of identification documents of the customer 120 (e.g., drivers license images, proof of address images, etc.), or other information related to the customer 120 associated with the transaction. One or more security rules stored in the transaction security configuration records 145 may be established for a transaction or transaction type, and may specify one or more transaction parameters that are to accompany a valid transaction request. As transaction requests are received at the transaction security server 110, the transaction parameters received with the transaction requests may be stored in the transaction parameters records 150 and indexed according to customer identifier codes.,\n",
       " 41 For example, a security rule may specify that, for a given transaction type and/or amount, an image of the customer and/or an image of the customer's identification card must accompany the transaction request. In this example, the transaction request may further include a customer identifier code. Using the customer identifier code, the transaction security server 110 may query the transaction parameters records 150 to retrieve an address, telephone number, date of birth, etc, for the customer 120, as well as a previously captured image of the customer. These previously stored transaction parameters, in conjunction with the new transaction parameter(s) provided with the transaction request (i.e., an image of the customer 120 taken in connection with the current transaction) may be used to authenticating the customer and approve the transaction.,\n",
       " 42 According to further embodiments, when the transaction parameters records 150 do not have a record stored for a customer 120 identified in a transaction request, the transaction security server 110 may be configured to create and store a record for that customer 120 as a part of an initial registration process (e.g., during the first transaction conducted with a given customer identification code).,\n",
       " 43 The authentication rule records 155 may be electronic records stored in memory and including information related to predetermined rules for given transactions. Generally, it can be appreciated that restrictions exist relating to certain transaction types, amount, frequency, etc. For example, certain rules may prohibit or control the transfer of currency, or a predetermined amount of currency, in to or out of a particular geographic region. Other rules may prohibit or control the ability of certain customers 120 to participate in some transactions (e.g., prohibit a convicted felon from purchasing a gun). Even further, some rules may limit the frequency of transactions for a particular customer 120 within a given time period (e.g., the number of times a customer 120 may be distributed certain items or provisions). The authentication rule records 155 include information relating to such transaction rules which can be utilized for each transaction as an additional form of transaction security and fraud prevention.,\n",
       " 44 Each of the records 145, 150, and/or 155 may be stored in memory, in one or more database(s), etc., either locally or remotely from the transaction information system 100.,\n",
       " 45 The transaction request module 135 may include logic, hardware, and the like to receive the security rule and store the security rule, associated with the point-of-transaction device 105, in the transaction security configuration records 145. The transaction request module 135 may also receive the transaction request from the point-of-transaction device 105 and access the transaction security configuration to retrieve the security rule associated with the point-of-transaction device 105 as well as the applicable at least one transaction parameter. According to some embodiments, the transaction request module 135 may compare certain of the retrieved information with the information contained in the transaction request to confirm that the transaction request complies with the security rule. For instance, if the transaction amount at least meets the triggering transaction amount from the security rule and the at least one transaction parameter requires an identification parameter that is an image of the customer that is to be verified, the transaction request module 135 may retrieve an image associated with the customer from the transaction parameters records 150 and compare the images to confirm the customer's identity and, thus, that the transaction request complies with the security rule. Other aspects may provide for the confirmation based on fingerprint comparison. If the transaction request module 135 cannot confirm the identity of the customer, the transaction request module 135 may reject that transaction or flag the transaction for manual review for identity confirmation.,\n",
       " 46 As discussed, some embodiments may provide for the transaction request module 135 to access records from the authentication rule records 155 to determine whether the customer 120 is authorized to engage in the transaction. As one example, if the transaction parameters records 150 indicate that the customer 120 has engaged in similar transaction types within a predetermined time period and the authentication rules records 155 indicate that a given customer is only permitted to engage in that type of transaction a predetermined number of times within the time period, the transaction request module 135 may determine that the customer 120, even though their identity has been confirmed, is rejected for that transaction.,\n",
       " 47 Other embodiments may provide for the transaction security server 110 to communicate with the third party 115 to confirm the identity of the customer 120. That is, the transaction request module 135 may communicate information associated with the customer 120 along with the identification parameter to the third party 115. According to some embodiments, the third party 115 accesses the information on the transaction security server 110 via a series of web pages, for example, to confirm the identity of the customer 120. The third party 160 may review the information and, in some instances, additional information maintained by the third party 160, to confirm the identity of the customer 120.,\n",
       " 48 Once the identity of the customer 120 has been confirmed and, when applicable, the customer 120 has been determined eligible for the transaction, the transaction security server 110 communicates a confirmation signal to the point-of-transaction device 105.,\n",
       " 49 The reporting module 140 may be configured to generate one or more reports relating to the records stored by the transaction security server 110. Exemplary reports may be for a particular customer 120, for a particular user 125, for a particular transaction type, for a particular transaction security rule, may be based on one or more predetermined time periods, and the like. In other embodiments the reporting module 140 is configured to dynamically generate custom reports or store one or more predefined reports that can be retrieved. The transaction security server 110 may communicate the reports to, for example, the third party 115, the user 125, and/or the customer 120. Other aspects provide for the transaction security server 110 to make the reports available via a series of one or more web pages accessible using a web browser.,\n",
       " 50 FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary communication flow 200 for secure transaction processing in accordance with various embodiments. Communication flow 200 may be used, for example, by the point-of-transaction device 105, the transaction security server 110, and the third party 115 of FIG. 1 for secure transaction processing.,\n",
       " 51 At 205, point-of-transaction device 105-a receives a selection of transaction parameters, from the user 125-a. The transaction parameters may include a transaction type, a triggering transaction amount, and at least one transaction parameter. The point-of-transaction device 105-a may be configured to create a security rule that associates the at least one transaction parameter with the transaction type and the triggering transaction amount. At 210, the point-of-transaction device 105-a stores the security rule. For example, the point-of-transaction device 105-a may store the security rule as a record in the security rules records 130. As discussed, the point-of-transaction device 105-a may apply the security to rule to subsequent transaction requests that matches the transaction type and/or the triggering transaction amount. As applied, the point-of-transaction device 105-a may be configured to prompt the user 125-a and/or customer 120 to capture certain information from the customer 120 prior to completing the transaction, e.g., capture an image of the customer. At 215, the point-of-transaction device 105-a communicates the security rule to the transaction security server 110-a. The transaction security server 110-a stores the security rule at 220.,\n",
       " 52 At 225, the user 125-a communicates a request for a transaction to the point-of-transaction device 105-a. The user 125-a may, for example, scan a barcode of an item being purchased by the customer as well as input information indicating whether the transaction is to be cash or card-based (e.g., by swiping the customer's credit card or pressing a cash button). At 230, the point-of-transaction device 105-a determines if the transaction request complies with the security rule. For example, the point-of-transaction device 105-a determines if the transaction amount/type match a triggering transaction amount and/or type and, if so, determines whether the associated security response has been met (as indicated by the associated at least one transaction parameter).,\n",
       " 53 At 235, the point-of-transaction device 105-a may forward at least a portion of the transaction request to the transaction security server 110-a. As can be appreciated, the transaction request may be forwarded to the transaction security server 110-a as an additional form of security. For example, the user 125-a and the customer 120 were mischievous collaborators, the user 125-a may input to the point-of-transaction device 105-a that the security rule requirement had been met, even though the image of the customer was not actually captured. Forwarding the transaction request to the transaction security server 110-a may provide an additional verification that the security rule requirements have been satisfied, that the identity of the customer has accurately been captured, and may even provide for authentication of the customer's identity.,\n",
       " 54 Thus, at 240, the transaction security server 110-a may store one or more transaction parameters associated with the transaction request (e.g., the transaction parameters specified by the applicable security rule(s)), and at 245, the transaction security server 110-a may determine whether to approve the transaction. The approval of the transaction may be based, for example, on a determination of whether the applicable security rule(s) for the transaction have been satisfied. Additionally or alternatively, the approval of the transaction may be based on an authentication of the customer's identity based on the transaction parameters received with the transaction request and/or previously stored transaction parameter received or obtained by the transaction security server 110-a in connection with previous transactions conducted by the customer.,\n",
       " 55 At 250, the transaction security server 110-a communicates a confirmation signal to the point-of-transaction device 105-a indicating that the transaction is authorized and the security rule has been complied with.

Communication flow 300 may be used, for example, by the user 125, the point-of-transaction device 105, and the transaction security server 110 of FIG. 1 for secure transaction processing. Generally, the communication flow 300 illustrates the circumstance where the transaction security server 110-b confirms, in whole or in part, the identity of the customer.,\n",
       " 57 At 305, point-of-transaction device 105-b receives a selection of transaction parameters, from the user 125-b. The transaction parameters may include the transaction type, the triggering transaction amount, and the at least one transaction parameter where the point-of-transaction device 105-b creates a security rule that associates the at least one transaction parameter with the transaction type and the triggering transaction amount. At 310, the point-of-transaction device 105-b stores the security rule in security rules records 130, for example. At 315, the point-of-transaction device 105-b receives a request for a transaction from the user 125-b. The transaction request may include a transaction amount, a transaction type, a customer identifier code identifying the customer to the transaction, and the like. The transaction request may further include an identification parameter of the customer that is captured in response to the security rule requirements. For instance, if the security rule requires an image of the customer for a given transaction amount/type, at least a portion of the transaction request may include capturing the customer's image and including the image in the transaction request. At 320, the point-of-transaction device 105-b determines if the transaction request complies with the security rule. For example, the point-of-transaction device 105-b may be configured to ensure that for a transaction amount that matches the triggering transaction amount and for a type of transaction that matches the transaction type, that the appropriate security requirement identified by the at least one transaction parameter has been complied with. If the transaction request complies with the security rule, the point-of-transaction device 105-b communicates at least a portion of the transaction request to the transaction security server 110-b. ,\n",
       " 58 At 330, the transaction security server 110-b authenticates or confirms the identity of the party to the transaction. As discussed, the transaction request may include a customer identifier code that is associated with the customer. The transaction security server 110-b may access one or more records storing information for the associated customer. Utilizing the information retrieves from the stored records, the transaction security server 110-b may compare the retrieved information with the identification parameter from the transaction request to confirm the identity of the customer. As one example, the identification parameter may be an image of the customer and the retrieved information may include a different image of the customer. In that example, the transaction security server 110-b may compare the images, using a facial recognition algorithm for example, to confirm the customer's identity. It is to be understood that the customer's identity may be confirmed based on the customer's fingerprint, based on images of the customer's identification card, and the like. At 335, the transaction authority 115-b communicates a confirmation signal to the point-of-transaction device 105-b indicating that the customer's identity has been confirmed and the transaction is approved.,\n",

Communication flow 400 may be used, for example, by the user 125, the point-of-transaction device 105, and the transaction security server 110 of FIG. 1 for secure transaction processing. Generally, the communication flow 400 illustrates the circumstance where a supervising agent 405 of the user 125-c determines the transaction parameters used to establish the security rule that are applicable to the user's point-of-transaction device. It is to be understood that the user supervising agent 405 is separate from the transaction security server 110-c, but is, at least to some degree, associated with the user 125-c utilizing the point-of-transaction device 105-c. ,\n",

According to some embodiments, the user supervising agent 405 may be an individual, a corporation, an agency, and the like, that is associated with the user 105-c. As one example, the user supervising agent 405 may be a corporate headquarters for a given company where multiple users 125-c may be individual locations operating under the company name and providing services to customers, e.g., each user 125-c may be a chain or franchise of the user supervising agent 405. According to another example, the user supervising agent 405 is a government agency providing a product/service where each user 125-c is a geographical office acting under the direction of the agency. As can be appreciated, the user supervising agent 405 is separate from the transaction security server 110-c and permits the corporate headquarters or government agency to customize their own security rules based on their individual needs. Accordingly, the user supervising agent 405 distributes the selections necessary to establish the security rules to each user 125-c (via the point-of-transaction device 105-c) to thereby set the security rules for each of its users. As such, the user supervising agent 405 maintains the discretion and ability to determine appropriate security rules rather than being limited to the security rules dictated by the credit card issuing companies, for example.,\n",

The transaction request may include a transaction amount, a transaction type, a customer identifier code identifying the customer to the transaction, as well as the identification parameter. At 425, the point-of-transaction device 105-c determines if the transaction request complies with the security rule, such as described above. If the transaction request complies with the security rule, the point-of-transaction device 105-c communicates at least a portion of the transaction request to the transaction security server 110-c. ,\n",
       " 62 At 435, the transaction security server 110-c optionally authenticates or confirms the identity of the party to the transaction. As discussed, the transaction security server 110-c may simply confirm that the transaction request complies with the security rule and, in some examples, store information associating the customer's identity with the transaction. According to other examples, the transaction security server 110-c may utilize a customer identifier code associated with the customer to query records to retrieve additional information associated with the customer. The transaction security server 110-c may utilize this information to confirm the identity of the customer before approving the transaction. At 440, the transaction security server 110-c communicates a confirmation signal to the point-of-transaction device 105-b indicating that the customer's identity has been confirmed and the transaction is approved.,\n",

       " 1 0001 This invention relates to custom manufacturing of apparel and more particularly to a method for a reordering interface for an existing individual whose information has been captured from or about the individual for whom the garment is to be made. More specifically, this invention relates to the ability to reorder pieces of apparel and make selection adjustments and adjust features of a piece of apparel from a previously purchased/ordered custom or standard off the shelf garment. ,\n",
       " 2 0002 Matching apparel consumers with garments that have all the desired properties, features, and fit is one of the biggest problems that apparel retailers face. The vast majority of apparel retailers struggle with managing the tradeoff between carrying a larger assortment of products and paying the high costs of carrying large amounts of inventory. A company choosing to offer a large assortment of products, product features or variations, and sizes quickly finds the costs of inventory, inventory handling costs, and infrastructure (e.g., distribution centers) become prohibitively large as the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) increases. On the other hand, a company with a more limited assortment will find that consumers either can't find the product or size they desire, or choose a product that often they are not satisfied with, and end up returning the garment. The combined cost associated with inventory and merchandise returns represents a significant portion of the overall costs for apparel retailers, especially those who sell through direct channels such as the Internet, TV, or mail. The lost revenue opportunity for apparel retailers of all types, including store based retailers, associated with not having the correct size or product in stock can easily make the difference between a struggling and successful company. ,\n",
       " 3 0003 Those consumers who find an apparel product in their size are often times settling for the best of the limited options available, rather than getting a garment that fits them properly. A survey cited in U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,519, issued to Sung K. Park on Aug. 20, 1996, for an apparatus and method for custom apparel manufacturing, found that the percentage of the population that is correctly fitted by an available standard-sized article of clothing without any alteration is only two percent. ,\n",
       " 4 0004 There are two fundamentally different approaches to helping apparel consumers find garments that best meet their needs. The first involves gathering or capturing information about a consumer and using that information to recommend particular brands, products, and sizes that are likely to fit or match a consumer's tastes. The benefit of this approach is that it theoretically increases the probability that a consumer will find the best available standard product. The drawback is that this approach doesn't solve the assortment-inventory tradeoff described above, nor does it resolve the issue of failure to achieve proper fit without further garment alteration. ,\n",
       " 5 0005 The second approach involves custom making of apparel garments for consumers after preference and sizing information has been captured. The apparatus and method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,548,519 is an example of this approach. This approach involves having consumers try on several products of predetermined dimensions until the consumer approves the fit and purchases the garment. At that point, the information captured during the try-on session is reported to a manufacturing system that begins the process of making the garment. Another approach, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,525, issued to Jacob Minsky on Sep. 21, 1999, for a method of measuring body measurements for custom apparel manufacturing, involves the use of multiple cameras in a specially designed room, capturing height and width data about a consumer. These data are then used to manufacture the clothing. ,\n",
       " 6 0006 These approaches do provide the manufacturing system with information that is useful in producing a custom garment, and will likely result in a better fitting garment than the standard sizes. Since the garments are made after the consumer order has been completed, there is less of a need for retailers to carry large amounts of finished-goods inventory. The downside of these approaches is that they require substantial involvement and time from the consumer. The majority of consumers find that shopping for apparel is not a particularly desirable activity, but rather a necessary evil. Any product that requires more involvement and more time from consumers will find limited potential in today's environment where an increasingly large number of household or personal needs can be met from a computer, a laptop, a PDA, or even a cell phone. ,\n",
       " 7 0007 Initially, at the time at which a first purchase is made, a consumer is asked a series of questions about themselves (or the person for whom they are purchasing the item), their preferences, desired features, and other product choices regarding the item that is being considered. The questions are asked in such a way that consumers can quickly provide the necessary information in order to complete the ordering process, without requiring the assistance of a store clerk or tailor. The information that is captured from or on behalf of the person for whom the item is intended serves as inputs to a set of model formulas that calculates other pieces of information needed for developing product specifications and production instructions for the manufacturing of a custom apparel product, but not provided directly by the consumer. SEE U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/909,930, filed on Jul. 20, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. ,\n",
       " 8 0008 A retailer's ability to retain a consumer for subsequent purchases is an important driver of business performance. Typically, the customer acquisition cost to a retailer is higher than the profit margin generated by the first basket of goods purchased by a consumer, so the retailer must rely on repeat visits and purchases over time in order to profit from an individual consumer When a consumer has confidence that the apparel available at a particular retailer fits them correctly, they are likely to make replenishment purchases, as well as purchase more products by selecting additional colors, styles, fashions, and product features For example, a consumer might like the fit of the piece of apparel but desire the garment to be a different color or be composed from a different fabric. A consumer could like the style and the feel of the piece of apparel but would like slight adjustments in the actual dimensions of the garment to suit the individual desires of the consumer. For example, a consumer might wish to wear the piece of apparel tighter or looser than the normal fit of the garment. A consumer might wish to reorder a pair of pants but would like to change the rise or the seat of the pants to fit individual likes and wants. ,\n",
       " 9 0009 It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for a reordering interface which allows existing consumers of an apparel retailer or brand to adjust a previously purchased piece of apparel to specifications that meet the consumer's desired wants and needs. The information can be communicated remotely over the phone, using the Internet, interactive television, via mail, or through any other communication device that is used for electronic commerce such as web-enabled phones or personal digital assistants (PDAs). This information can also be communicated directly to a retailer's agent, a kiosk, or any other information capture tool in a store environment. An object of the invention is to create a system that is easy to utilize and entices a customer to return to the reordering interface and make future purchases from the retailer. ,\n",
       " 10 0010 It is an object of the invention to provide a reordering interface to allow a consumer to reorder pieces of apparel they desire but to make adjustments to the reordered garments to meet individual needs. During a previous purchase, information may be generated regarding the article of clothing. Basic information regarding the ordered article's type, style, fabric, color, size, and garment dimensions may be stored for later use. ,\n",
       " 11 0011 It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of user interfacing to reorder products that can be customized based on an individual person's body shape, lifestyle attributes, and product preferences in order to allow customers to quickly, easily, and conveniently order custom apparel. ,\n",
       " 12 0012 Another object of the present invention is to use a system and method of determining necessary product specifications such as garment dimensions based upon both consumer-provided and model-derived human body dimensions that provides retailers and manufacturers of these products with all the necessary dimensions and other specifications required to produce a custom apparel product. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for adjusting calculated garment dimensions on the basis of consumer-selected garment fit preferences. ,\n",
       " 13 0013 A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of shopping for products that can be customized based on an individual person's body shape and product preferences as a marketing and sales tool for retailers and manufacturers to provide custom apparel for consumers. ,\n",
       " 14 0014 A still further object of the invention is to provide an adjustment capability for a purchaser who has originally purchased a garment that fits very poorly, poorly, relatively well, or quite well. ,\n",
       " 15 0015 Another still further object of the invention is to provide the capacity to ask a consumer to request an adjustment to a garment dimension that the consumer would not be able to specify at the time of purchasing an initial garment. ,\n",
       " 16 0016 These and other features of the present invention are described in more detail in the following detailed description. The scope of the invention, however, is limited only by the claims appended hereto. ,\n",
       " 17 0017 It is consistent with the present invention to provide a method for allowing a user to reorder an article fitted to a human being comprising: providing the user access to a reordering interface through a user interface; allowing the user to customize the article, via said user interface, during a session with a customizing interface through the use of a visual aid; allowing the user to reorder the article, via said user interface. It is also consistent with the present invention to provide a system allowing a user to reorder an article fitted to a human being comprising: a reordering interface allowing the user to customize the article during a session with a customizing interface through the use of a visual aid and allowing the user to reorder the article.,\n",
       " 18 0018 There are numerous ways an apparel retailer can capture necessary information from a consumer interested in purchasing apparel, both remotely and in-store. Reordering information for apparel can be recaptured in a similar manner. Remotely, the interested consumer can access a retailer's web site through any number of user interfaces such as a computer, a PDA, a web enabled phone, interactive television, or any other electronic medium used to access the Internet. Also remotely, the interested consumer can call a retailer's customer service or ordering center, or they could send a fax or use any form of mail. In a store environment, the interested consumer could either provide the information directly to an employee of the retailer, or use any self-service device in the store such as a kiosk, Internet terminal or customer service telephone. ,\n",
       " 19 0019 In a preferred embodiment, the potential consumer would log on to the retailer's web site wherein the consumer has previously purchased standard and/or customized items from that retailer. This web site may have a combination of standard and custom products, or may offer exclusively custom made products (a pair of pants, a pair of jeans, a sweater, a skirt, a dress, a shirt, a blouse, a vest, a jacket, a coat, a pair of knickers, a pair of leggings, a jersey, a pair of shorts, a leotard, a pair of underwear, a hat, a cap, and a swimming or bathing suit). A potential customer may log on to the reordering interface by providing admittance security information to allow the reordering interface access to previously purchased garments by the user for reordering in the first selection interface. The typical security information to be used would be a logon id and a password. ,\n",
       " 20 0020 A customer order history of all previous pieces of apparel purchased by the user may be listed for the consumer. The user then may begin to make choices about reordering the product the consumer desires from the purchasing history of the consumer. The customer order history would detail information concerning previously purchased items. In the case of pants, the user would be provided with detailed information regarding the item number, the product name, the fabric, the color, the style, as well as the selected cuffs, pleats, and the type of fly (zipper or button) that was ordered in a previous purchase. These are just some of the feature and style choices that could be available. ,\n",
       " 21 0021 After logging on an informational banner may be displayed informing the potential customer of their location in the reordering interface. The information banner may detail the steps during the reordering process that the consumer has completed and/or needs to complete. The list could include an order history indicator, a sizing indicator, a design indicator, and sign-off mechanism to allow the user to move between the selection interfaces. The information banner may appear on all of the selection interfaces providing ease of movement for the user to shift from one selection interface to another. ,\n",
       " 22 0022 Once the potential consumer has selected a piece of apparel to reorder, the potential customer can view the selected garment for reordering and customize the features of the reordered piece of garment to individual tastes of the potential customer in the second selection interface. By being able to adjust features and sizes the customer may enjoy a greater fit and feel to the article delivering a higher level of satisfaction to the user from the purchase of the article. A satisfied customer may return to the reordering interface to purchase further items from the reordering interface. A customer may be more likely to reorder from an interface if provided with excellent services and an individual feel to the first order and subsequent reorder purchases. Satisfied customers may be more likely to reorder than unsatisfied ones. Reorders may mean the retailer will realize higher sales. In addition, the satisfied customer may inform other potential consumers of the reorder customer's satisfaction with the reorder interface. The new potential customers may interact with the interface, purchase articles from the retailer, and then be able to make adjustments via the reordering interface. This may also generate additional sales for the retailer. ,\n",
       " 23 0023 In the second selection interface, a detailed description of the previously ordered item may appear to remind the potential customer of the style and features of the previous purchase. The detailed description may include such aspects as type of garment, color, type of fabric, and individual customized features for each garment like cuffs for pants or button down collar for shirts. In the preferred embodiment, the reordered garment may be customized by selecting a fabric type and/or a color type that are available for the selected garment. The potential customer may also customize style features. In the most preferred embodiment, the potential customer could select whether the pants should have a flat front, forward pleats, or reverse pleats. In the preferred embodiment the potential customer can select whether pants should have cuffs or not. All of the customizing adjustments may be limited by the type of reordered article selected by the user. For example, if a user decides on a type of fabric and a color that is unavailable for that garment, the user may be restricted from selecting the unavailable color. ,\n",
       " 24 0024 A Help Area may provide a potential customer with further information describing any of the features of the piece of apparel that are unclear to the potential customer. For example, if a user clicks on the help mechanism for fabric type, a breakdown of the fabric's materials such as whether the fabric is composed of 100% cotton or combination of materials maybe displayed to the user. ,\n",
       " 25 0025 With the third selection interface, the user may customize the size of the reordered piece of apparel. A visual design featuring the type of garment selected may aid the potential customer in customizing the garment's dimensions to fit a need of the customer. In the preferred embodiment, the visual design may display a pair of pants and show the various customizing adjustments that can be made to a pair of pants. The adjustment display provided for the pair of pants may refer to how alterations will occur on the article of apparel that is to be reordered. Each adjustment may correspond to an adjustment on the reorder article. For example, a tightening in the waist of a pair of pants by one-inch on the visual display may relate to a one-inch reduction on the actual pair of pants to be reordered. In the preferred embodiment, the visual design may display the waist size, the rise of the pants, the seat of the pants, length of the pants, and the leg opening. For a long-sleeved shirt, the visual design may display the neck size, length of sleeves, size of the arm openings, length of the body of the shirt, and width of the shirt. Size adjustment features may be limited by the style of the garment selected. All selected feature changes may be stored and the reordered piece of apparel may be adjusted according to the selections by the customer. ,\n",
       " 26 0026 In the third selection interface a visual design may aid the potential customer to make sizing adjustments to the piece of apparel. In the preferred embodiment the visual aid design may be a ruler. The ruler may be centered at zero and the customer may be allowed to adjust the selected size to tighten or loosen, in predetermined size increments, the piece of apparel depending on the potential customer's desires. In the preferred embodiment, the potential customer may adjust a pair of pants' waist size, seat size, pants rise, pants length, and the leg openings in selected increments by the use of a visual aid such as a slider, ruler, or another type of depiction of numerical increment. The visual aid may allow the customer to adjust a feature and the adjustment to the feature may correspond to adjustments to the actual article for a custom fitted article of clothing. The predetermined size increments may have maximum tightening and loosening limits because if the potential customer exceeds those limits it may be more efficient for the potential customer to order a new article of apparel instead of reordering the same garment. If an adjustment on the visual adjustment display is shortened or tightened a minus sign may appear in the size increment to denote a tightening or shortening of the article of apparel. Positive numbers may relate to a loosening or lengthening of the article at that visual adjustment. For example, waist adjustments may be limited by plus or minus three inches. Any further adjustments may require a user to order a new item. A potential customer could access a help area to further describe or define any of features of the piece of apparel that are unclear to the potential customer. A help aid may provide assistance to the user to understand how adjustments can be determined and how adjustments will affect the wear of the article of clothing. The help aid for the rise of the pair of pants may detail how a greater rise will affect how a user wears the pants; either lower or higher on the waist depending on the adjustments made. ,\n",
       " 27 0027 In a preferred embodiment the leg opening feature may not be adjusted by a ruler but by a display of whether the user would like to widen or narrow the pants. The narrowing or widening adjustments could be either a small adjustment or a large adjustment. The alterations in the leg opening would correspond to actual changes in the reorder article. ,\n",
       " 28 0028 The information that is collected for sizing may be information that most apparel consumers know about themselves, and that can be used to either (1) directly determine desired measurements for the design of the garment pattern, or (2) estimate, either alone or in conjunction with other pieces of information, other necessary measurements for the design of the garment pattern. Consumers may also be asked to make assessments of themselves and their body shape, as well as to take simple measurements of certain of their body dimensions if the user's body shape has altered since the last order or they wish to make slight variations for comfort. ,\n",
       " 29 0029 Once the reorder information is collected from the potential consumer, the adjustments made in the first, second, and third selection interfaces may be combined with information captured and/or generated during the previous order purchase to create the customized reordered article for the fourth selection interface. ,\n",
       " 30 0030 In the preferred embodiment, a summary of the order including the adjustments to the reordered article may be displayed in the fourth selection interface. The fourth selection interface may provide a recap of the reorder with the customizations completed by the user. In the preferred embodiment, all of the features selected and stored may be provided to the user to allow the user to make alterations to the adjustment. In the preferred embodiment the user may be able to view how the size adjustments may affect the reorder article. For example, in a pair of pants if the potential consumer had adjusted the waist to be looser by one inch, the size recap may say Your pant waist will be loosened by 1. Tightening, shortening, and lengthening adjustments may be displayed in a similar manner. In the preferred embodiment, if any adjustments to size are made a distinguishing marker may be provided to alert the user to the adjustments made. If the user did not make any adjustments to the size then no distinguishing marker may be provided by the fourth selection interface. In the preferred embodiment, the fourth selection interface may allow a user to purchase the reorder article or return to other selection interfaces to alter any adjustments that had been made to the reorder article. The fourth selection interface may allow the user to correct errors made by the user. The fourth interface may provide a higher level of satisfaction to the user to ensure the user receives a suitable reorder article. ,\n",
       " 31 0031 A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the preferred embodiments are not limited to specific articles fitted for a human being and the reordering interface would encompass, but not be limited by, all pieces of apparel listed and adjustments made to the apparel, as well as various other articles of manufacture that must be fitted to a human being. ]"
